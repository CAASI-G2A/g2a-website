# Grief To Action Website
After cloning the repo, you will need to follow along with these two pages:
To get started, please check out the [Setup](https://github.com/CAASI-G2A/g2a-website/wiki/Setup) guide, which walks through the setup process.
Next is the [home page](https://github.com/CAASI-G2A/g2a-website/wiki) which houses the rest of the other important pages and links to valuable resources.

After this, it would be helpful to read up on [Code-Flows](https://github.com/CAASI-G2A/g2a-website/wiki/Code-Flows), which gives a high level overview of where to look for important code features.
