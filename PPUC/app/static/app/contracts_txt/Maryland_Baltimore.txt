For reference purposes, the present vacation schedule is as follows: 
COMPLETED YRS OF CONTINUOUS SERVICE  VACATION DAYS EARNED PER MONTH  PER YEAR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE

4. 
It is not the intent of Section 1.2 to preclude a member from making a vacation period using more than two (2) P or PL days. However, this type of vacation period would not receive the same protection against cancellation as that described in Section H.3.

2. 
Notice of cancellation given less than fourteen (14) days shall entitle the employee to an additional four (4) hours compensation at his or her regular rate of pay. (Five (5) hours for employees working a ten (10) hour shift). In addition, the employee shall receive the day back. 

3. 
If a Holiday Leave day (P day) is cancelled, the employee shall be permitted to utilize this day within the remaining time period, as set forth in Article 8, Section A, or within sixty (60) days, whichever period is greater. 

4. 
In the event two (2) or more employees have scheduled and approved Holiday Leave on the same day and it becomes necessary to cancel said leave, the last requested leave shall be the first cancelled, unless the employees agree otherwise. 

5. 
When Holiday Leave cannot, for operational reasons, be granted within the specified period, the District/Unit Commander may, at his discretion, approve either an exception to the time restriction or authorize payment for the holiday at the employee's specified overtime rate. 


K. SCHEDULED DAYS OFF (H DAYS) 
1. 
An employee shall be given a minimum of fourteen (14) days' notice of any change in his or her Regular Scheduled Days Off (H days) which are not being taken in conjunction with an approved vacation as provided in Sections H.1 and I.3 of this Article. Notice given of less than fourteen (14) days shall entitle the employee to an additional four (4) hours compensation at his or her regular rate of pay (five (5) hours for employees on the 4x 10 schedule). 

2. 
An employee who has an H Day cancelled, whether with more than 14 days' notice or otherwise, shall receive four (4) hours pay (five (5) hours in the case of employees working the 4 x 10 shift). The employee shall also have the right to take the cancelled day off if it can be scheduled within the same work period, governed by manpower constraints. If the employee is unable to reschedule the substitute day off within the same work period, the employee shall receive pay only for the cancelled day at his or her regular rate of pay for the day forfeited (i.e. 10 hours for those on the 4x10 schedule and 8 hours for those on an 8 hour schedule). This pay shall be in addition to any penalty that may be required under section 1, above. 

3. 
An employee retains the option to request a change in his or her regularly scheduled H days within the twenty-eight (28) day work period. His or her immediate supervisor may grant the request. In that circumstance, the above provisions of this Section shall not apply 

4. 
Regardless of the foregoing sections 1 and 2, The Employer shall have the right to designate five (5) days each year on or after February 21 (immediately following the close of the February 20 vacation period) on which all H days will be considered cancelled. Employees working on such H days will be paid time and one-half for working such days but shall have no right to take the day off. The only exception to this provision shall be for those employees who have scheduled vacation days (and any H days in conjunction with that vacation) during the annual scheduling period, who shall not have their vacation or H days cancelled on the days designated in this Section 4. 


L. SCHEDULED DAYS CHANGED OR CANCELLED 
An employee's scheduled days off or approved leave shall not be changed or 
cancelled solely for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime, over the objection of 
the employee. This provision shall not apply if such day is cancelled for operational reasons.

ARTICLE 27  

MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY PARTI POLICY 
A. Effective June 25, 1997, new employees of the Police Department shall accrue medical leave at the rate of one (1) day for each month of completed service. Employees must be in pay status at any time during the payroll period in which their anniversary date occurs in order to accrue medical leave. Accrued medical leave may be used for non-line­of-duty illnesses or injuries. Employees hired after June 25, 1997, shall be included in the same medical leave program and policy for line-of-duty illnesses or injuries as those employees hired prior to June 25, 1997. 
Employees who accrue medical leave at the rate of one (1) day for each month of completed service shall be permitted to utilize any accrued medical leave in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act. Employees hired before June 25, 1997, shall continue to use medical leave on an as needed basis. 
B. In the event that an employee shall suffer a line-of-duty injury or illness, said employee shall remain in paid status without being charged medical leave until such time as a decision is made by the Department's designee as to whether or not the injury or illness shall be classified as line-of-duty or non-line-of-duty. The employee shall be paid an amount equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3) of his/her regular pay · which may be excluded from federal adjusted gross income and therefore is not subject to either federal or state income tax (standard Workers Compensation benefit). In addition, the Employer shall provide a supplement to the standard Worker's Compensation benefit so that the gross pay of employees is equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the employee's regular gross pay. If it is determined that the injury is non-line-of-duty and the employee has been paid for days in excess of his accrued leave days, he shall repay or be docked for such pay. An employee may repay any amount owed by using medical leave, vacation or P and PL days or by having his pay docked; provided, however, that in no instance shall the Department dock an employee more than 25% of any paycheck. 
PART II NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 
A. Any employee who is unable to report to work because of medical leave must contact his or her Unit of assignment not later than one (1) hour prior to the scheduled tour of duty unless exigent circumstances exist. 
B. An employee on medical leave will be required to call in only on the first day of any absence, indicating the expected date of return, the reason for the absence, and the address and telephone number where confined if different from that on file with the Department. In cases where the employee does not return to work on the expected date, a second call shall be made repeating the same information. 
C. When an employee is home and on medical leave, the employee must notify his or her Unit of assignment when leaving home and upon return. An employee is to remain at home, except to go to a medical facility, pharmacy, polling place, place of worship, or retail outlet which sells primarily food, or in the event of exigent circumstances. Employees may not leave home for any other reason, except with the approval of their personal physician, their Commanding Officer/designee or the Medical Section. The basis for the preceding is to allow employees who are unable to work because of illness or injury to leave their home for personal needs which are basic. Abuse of this procedure constitutes a violation of this Policy and is subject to disciplinary action. In the event an employee receives approval from the Medical Director for unrestricted medical leave at home, the notification of his or her Unit of assignment when leaving and returning home shall be waived. There shall be no home visits between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
PART III MEDICAL CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 
A. A medical certification is required from all employees for all absences of three (3) or more consecutive days, and must be submitted to the employee's Unit of assignment upon returning to work. 
B. A medical certification must contain the following information: 
1. 
Date and time the employee was treated; 

2. 
Address and phone number of the doctor or practitioner; 

3. 
Date and doctor's authorized signature; 

4. 
Nature of illness or injury complained of; 

5. 
Diagnosis and treatment; and 

6. 
Expected date of return to duty. 


C. Any employee who is on medical leave shall not be required to report to any medical facility for the purpose of determining that employee's fitness for duty between the hours of 
7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. This provision shall not apply to employees in the medical abuse program. 
PART IV MEDICAL LEAVE ABUSE CONTROL PROGRAM 
A. Any employee who in a twelve (12) month period utilizes a total of eight (8) uncertified medical days, or who reports on medical leave on four (4) separate uncertified occasions, or who utilizes fifteen (15) or more medical days regardless of certification, may be placed in the Medical Leave Abuse ·Control Program, hereafter known as 11the Program," by his or her Commanding Officer after consultation with the Medical Section. 
Nothing in this Policy shall be construed to prevent the Police Commissioner from taking formal disciplinary action for violation of the policies of the Department. First consideration, however, should be given to the application of the Program. 
B. An uncertified medical day or occasion is the use of medical leave, regardless of duration, for which no doctor's certificate (as outlined in Part II, Section B) is submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor. 
C. In addition, an employee who uses medical leave in a manner described below may be placed in the Program: 
1. 
Uncertified usage before or after regular days off (three (3) occasions); 

2. 
Uncertified usage on any specific tour of duty in the case of those employees who rotate shifts (three (3) occasions); 

3. 
Uncertified usage on a specific day of the week (three (3) occasions); or 

4. 
Usage of medical leave after being denied other leave (two (2) occasions). 


D. Commanding Officers will retain the discretionary authority to exempt employees meeting the above criteria, based on mitigating factors. Command will consult the Medical Section prior to placing any employee in the Program. 
E. Both the Department and the Lodge recognize that by its very nature police work carries with it the risk of severe injury. For this reason, any employee who sustains a significant injury in the performance of his or her duties during the twelve (12) month period will be exempted for that period in all cases where his or her medical record would not otherwise justify inclusion in the Program. 
1. The exemption stated above will expire upon the earlier of: 
(a) 
The passage of twelve (12) months from the date of injury; or 

(b) 
The employee reaching maximum benefit of medical treatment for this injury as determined by his or her treating physician and/or the Medical Doctor. 


2. The Medical Director shall make the determination in these matters. 
F. An employee shall remain in the Medical Leave Abuse Control Program for one (1) year from the date of being so designated. Continued absenteeism for medical reasons may subject the employee to an extension in the Program and/or may constitute just cause for disciplinary action. 
G. Upon placement or extension in the Program, the employee shall be notified in writing by his or her Commanding Officer within five (5) working days. This written notification shall also include the date the employee is scheduled to return to normal status. 
H. An employee placed in the Program may appeal through the established grievance procedure. For the purposes of this Program, in Step 4 of the grievance procedure, the Director of the Personnel Division shall be the Police Commissioner's designee. 
I. When an employee who has been placed in the Program is home on medical leave, the employee must notify his or her Unit of assignment when leaving home and upon return. An employee is to remain at home except to go to a medical facility, pharmacy, polling place, place of worship, or retail outlet which sells primarily food, or in the event of exigent circumstances. Employees may not leave home for any other reason, except with the approval of their Commanding Officer/designee. Should the employee be refused permission to leave home and should the employee feel that there is a medical necessity for this request, said employee may appeal the denial to the Medical Director. 
J. Any employee who utilizes less than eight (8) medical days and less than four ( 4) separate occasions during the one (1) year period as designated will automatically return to normal status. 
Commanding Officers will retain the discretionary authority to return an employee to normal status who exceeds the above guidelines in a case where he or she suffers a clear­cut, bona fide, line-of-duty injury during the time frame in question. 
K. The Lodge shall be notified on a quarterly basis of all bargaining unit employees placed into the Medical Leave Abuse Control Program as well as those who have completed the Program and are returning to regular status. 
L. An employee who has been placed in the Medical Leave Abuse Control Program shall be subject to the following sanctions: 
1. 
The employee shall be required to obtain a doctor's certificate for all subsequent uses of medical leave, regardless of duration, while in the Program. This certificate must be submitted within two (2) working days after the employee returns to duty. 

2. 
Notwithstanding other provisions of this Memorandum, secondary employment privileges and participation in other overtime details shall be suspended while the employee is in the Program. 

3. 
No overtime compensation shall be awarded to the employee for the purpose of obtaining medical certification. 


PARTY 
PENALTIES 
A. An employee accused of violating the provisions of the Medical Leave Abuse Control Program is entitled to a hearing before any action may be taken as a result of this Section. After a determination has been made that an employee has violated any of the provisions of the Program, he or she shall in addition to loss of wages for the day(s) not worked be disciplined in accordance with the following procedures: 
1. 
One (1) day's suspension without pay for the first violation. 

2. 
Suspension without pay for three (3) days and forfeiture of secondary employment opportunities for an additional twelve (12) months for the second violation. 

3. 
Trial Board with a view toward termination for the third violation. 


B. This provision shall not apply to absences preceding an employee's placement in the Medical Leave Abuse Control Program. 
PART VI INCENTIVE FOR NON-USE OF MEDICAL LEAVE 
A. The Department will provide the following incentives for non-use of medical leave: 
1. Effective July 1, 2002, and continuing thereafter, employees shall earn three 
(3) 
days of paid leave for each six (6) months when medical leave is not used during each of the periods from July 1 to December 31 and January 1 to June 30. Any employee who completes an entire fiscal year without medical leave shall receive two 

(2) 
additional paid leave days. 


2. 
This accumulated paid leave will be converted to Vacation Leave the following fiscal year to be used any time during that fiscal year. 

3. 
The above incentive program shall apply only to those employees who worked in a full duty status, with the exception of those employees who have not reached maximum benefit of medical treatment for line-of-duty injuries and are in a restricted duty status. The incentive program shall apply to those employees who are in a restricted status and performing the essential functions of a full-duty position. 

4. 
Any employee who was otherwise qualified to receive the benefits of this Section, and who suffered an injury while performing his/her official duties may appeal to the Medical Director for restoration of those benefits for a period of one year from the date that employee returns to work from his/her line of duty injury. Final determination in these matters shall rest with the Medical Director. 


PART VII VACATION LEAVE ACCRUAL DURING SICK TIME 
A. Effective July 1, 1991, employees will not accrue Vacation Leave in any month during which they were carried on sick leave for the entire period. Similarly, any employee who remains on line-of-duty medical ("A" Time) for a period of six (6) months will cease to accrue Vacation Leave during subsequent months in which he or she is on medical ("A" Time) for the entire month. In case of severe line-of-duty injuries and upon written request, the six (6) month provision shall be waived only upon recommendation of the Medical Doctor. 
B. If an employee and/or the City successfully recovers monies for salary paid while on medical leave as a result of third-party litigation, those days of medical leave repaid to the City or Department shall be removed from the employee's medical leave totals. This would apply to line-of-duty and non-line-of-duty injury cases. 
In the event that such removal of medical leave days (a) would qualify the employee for the benefits of Part V of this Article and/or (b) would not have resulted in the non­accrual of Vacation Leave in Section A above, the employee shall receive all incentive days for non-use of medical leave and Vacation Leave days to which he or she would otherwise have been entitled under this Article. 
ARTICLE 28 
LAYOFFS 
A. NOTICE OF LAYOFF 
The Department shall give each affected employee not less than thirty (30) days' advance notice that he or she will be laid off. The Notice shall advise the employee of the expected period of layoff, if known, and that the employee's rights in the circumstances may be found in the Memorandum of Understanding and applicable provisions of the Civil Service Regulations. The Department agrees to furnish a copy of each Notice to the Lodge and to meet with Lodge Representatives promptly to resolve any questions arising under this Memorandum. 
B. ORDER OF LAYOFF 
There shall be no layoff in any rank so long as unfilled, funded positions are budgeted and charged to the Department in that rank and approved for fill by the City Finance Department. Recruits and probationary officers shall be laid off before any other employee in the bargaining unit. The next order of layoff will be those employees rated "unsatisfactory" or "needs improvement" on their last three (3) consecutive ratings. Thereafter, employees shall be laid off in seniority order, the least senior employee being laid off first; except that if the Department determines that operational reasons require retention of an employee of the unit having an essential skill, such as a helicopter pilot or a specialty requiring a state license or certification (other than MPTC), he or she may be retained. Seniority means total length of Departmental Service. In the event two (2) employees of the unit have equal seniority, the tie shall be broken on the basis of their last written performance evaluation. 
C. HIRING DURING LAYOFF 
No employee may be hired to perform the duties normally performed by a bargaining unit employee while he or she is in layoff status, except to meet operational needs of the Department for employees having an essential skill, as defined in Paragraph B, or in accordance with the "bumping" provisions of the Department's Memorandum of Understanding with Unit II. 
D. RECALL RIGHTS 
Laid-off bargaining unit employees shall enjoy the right to be reinstated within eighteen (18) months from the effective date of the layoff to any vacant position for which they are qualified. Reinstatement shall be in reverse order of layoff or reduction in rank (i.e., by seniority). When the Department offers reinstatement to a laid-off employee, it shall give him or her notice by registered mail, return receipt requested, and afford the affected employee reasonable time, not to exceed twenty (20) days, within which to accept reinstatement.

RE: Secondary Employment 
Dear President Ryan: 
This letter will affirm our agreement in principle, to allow members of FOP, Unit I and Unit II to engage in secondary employment in uniform and armed with the issued service weapon within the limits of Baltimore City. The Police Commissioner shall exercise sole authority to determine whether, in all circumstances, each individual employment in which the uniform is to be worn should be permitted, based upon, but not limited to, the type of work, the suitability of the employer, and the number of scheduled hours the members will devote to the employment, in compliance with department policy and other operational considerations. A member may work in approved secondary employment not to exceed thirty-two (32) hours per week. No more than twenty (20) of those hours shall be worked in assignments outside those administered by the Overtime Unit unless the remaining 12 hours of City Secondary are not available, in which case the member may work up to the 32 hour limit. The Police Commissioner may authorize other approved secondary not subject to the twenty (20) hour limit such as hotels, hospitals, and schools. 
During a week where the member is off five (5) or more leave days, other than medical leave, a member shall not work more than forty (40) hours of approved secondary employment. 
The Police Commissioner reserves the right to revoke permission previously granted at any time. The 
decision of the Police Commissioner in these matters shall be final and not subject to grievance 
procedures set forth in any collective bargaining agreements. 
The guidelines set forth in General Order (GO Q-2) shall govern the terms of this policy, based on recommendations of a committee comprised of my designees and members of the FOP, Lodge #3.

RE: Administratively Closed LLD. Cases 
Dear President Ryan: 
Effective July 1, 2003, in instances where the Legal Affairs Division makes a recommendation to administratively close a sustained case, such case shall be brought before a Departmental Hearing Board or other administrative process as determined appropriate by the Police Commissioner, and dismissed as not viable for prosecution. Cases so dismissed will result in all related charges previously sustained by I.A.D. to revert to a non-sustained finding upon dismissal. The non­sustained charges would then be subject to the expungement provisions of the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights {LEOBR). 
Cases so closed within the five year period immediately preceding the effective date of this Agreement, may be considered for dismissal pursuant to the above procedures provided the member makes written application on a form provided by the Department. The Department will consider requests to close cases beyond the five-year period on a case-by-case basis. The Police Commissioner reserves the right to suspend this review process in the event the process creates an administrative burden which impedes the effective operation of the Divisions, Sections, or Units involved. In the event the process is suspended, the parties shall meet and confer to find a reasonable solution to the administrative issues and resume the process as determined appropriate by mutual agreement.

In the event that a member shall be investigated for an on-duty use of deadly force, (including but not limited to discharging of a firearm), the member shall not be required to submit to drug screening and/or alcohol testing unless there is reasonable suspicion to believe the member acted under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. Changes to this standard are reserved to the Police Commissioner and may be changed at his discretion.

RE: BALTIMORE CITYPOLICE DEPARTMENT-ARTICLES 6 AND 16 
Dear President Ryan: 
This letter will confirm the agreement reached by the City and the FOP regarding two provisions in the new MOU: 
1. 
Article 6 Grievance and Arbitration: It is agreed that should an employee or the Union desire to file a grievance, it must be filed beginning at Step 1 and continuing if necessary through the remaining Steps and only then to arbitration. The only exception to this requirement that all grievance steps are mandatory shall be in cases of a group or class grievance which m<1y be instituted at Step 3 or where the parties mutually agree to skip one or more steps in the grievance process. 

2. 
Article 16, A.2 The parties have agreed to interpret this section to mean that if an employee is charged with a felony and suspended without pay pursuant to Article 16, Al, he/she will be entitled to reinstitution to pay status with all benefits, and lost pay back to the date on which pay was stopped, effective when the felony charges are dismissed or the officer is found not guilty. The employee shall be eligible for back pay under these circumstances even if there is a separate misdemeanor which has not been dismissed or adjudicated as not guilty. 


Please accept this Side Letter as compliance with our understanding.
