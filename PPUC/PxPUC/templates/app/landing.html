        We are Grief to Action (G2A), an interdisciplinary working group at the
        University of Pittsburgh dedicated to empowering marginalized
        communities through data science. A project of the Center for Analytical
        Approaches to Social Innovation (CAASI), we are composed of GSPIA
        students, alumni, and staff, community activists, undergrads, and
        faculty from 3 schools across Pitt and outside of Pitt, united in the
        conviction that Black Lives Matter. .

        When the George Floyd protests began this summer, CAASI Director Sera
        Linardi reached out to the Pitt community and invited students, faculty,
        and staff to join her in a weekly Zoom call to discuss ways to turn our
        grief into action. We came together in heartbreak and outrage and even a
        sense of helplessness-- what could we do? We’ve met nearly every week
        since to discuss this question, and currently have two projects under
        development: Project Black Business and Project Police Union Contract.
      </p>

        PBB works to increase the visibility of Pittsburgh’s black owned
        business on University of Pittsburgh’s campus and throughout the city.
        We work together with community partners (Cocoapreneur, Vibrant
        Pittsburgh, Community Forge, Blackowned.PGH, Black Action Society and
        more) to build platforms to help support black owned businesses. Through
        these platforms such as online reviews, social media and community
        engagement, we are connecting the community with black owned businesses
        to build a sustainable future.

        PPUC analyzes police union contracts to help demystify the process of
        filing a police misconduct complaint. We thank Campaign Zero for sharing
        their data with us. Access our Complaint Tool here to learn about the
        process of filing a complaint. Access our searchable database of police
        union contracts here to learn more about problematic language in
        contracts.
