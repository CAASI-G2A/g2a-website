                                    <p> In Pittsburgh there are two places to file a police misconduct complaint. The Office of Municipal Investigations (OMI) is the City's investigative branch and investigates all complaints filed against any city employees, including police and fire. The Citizens Police Reivew Board (CPRB) is an independent review board staffed with non-city employees. Three members are appointed by the mayor, and two members have to be experienced law professionals. You can choose which one to file the complaint with. Both of these agencies only investigate complaints involving the Pittsburgh Bureau's officers, not outside municipalites. The details, forms, and contact information for both are below. </p>
                                                        <p>To file a complaint with the Citizens Police Review Board (CPRB), you can fill out this online <a target='_blank' href="https://cprbpgh.org/about/filing-a-complaint/file-a-complaint-now">form</a> to file an "informal complaint". Someone from CPRB will contact you within 10 days to help you file an official complaint. The investigation process will not start until an official complaint is filed.

                                    <p>OMI and CPRB have different ways of reviewing complaints they recieve.</p>

That person gathers information from you, witnesses, and any other people involved. At CPRB, all complaints are taken through in an intake coordinator, passed to the executive director, and then assigned to an investigator.</p>

                                    <p>Both CPRB and OMI have their own investigation structure. Depending on which one you file your complaint with, you will experience a different process.</p>
                                                        <p>The process for complaints filed through OMI should take no longer than 120 days from when you file. Once your complaint is assigned an investigator, that person will contact you, witness, and the officers involved to create a full summary of the incidient. That information will be passed to city leadership including the Office of Public Safety where they will decide on the appropriate punishment. The written result and discipline decision will be sent to the officer and their supervisor.</p>
                                                                            <p>Once you file a formal complaint with CPRB including a notarized affidavit, the investigator assigned to your complaint goes over the details and decides if it should be dismissed or presented to the board. If it goes to the board, they either decide to dismiss it or start a preliminary inquiry which takes last 10 buisness days. During this time, the investigator conducts interviews with witnesses, the victim, and the officer in question. They gather documents and request any additonal information they might need from OMI. The inquiry is then brought back to the board who either can decide to dismiss or offer the option of mediation between the citizen and officer. If anyone chooses not to do mediation, the complaint moves to a full investigation with more interviews and research. This review is completed in 30 days and if it requires more time, you will be notified in writing. It then goes back to the board who either dismiss or order a public hearing. You will get a 10 day advance notice of the hearing date. The Hearing panel is made up of three individuals chosen by the CPRB execuitve director. A special prosecutor will represent the complaint and provide the evidence to the panel from the investigation. A final decision is announced publicly either 10 days later or by the next CPRB board meeting, whichever is later. You will be directly notified, the officer in question is notified, and the discipline recommendation is given to the mayor and the police cheif.</p>""",

Generally, the form of discipline that is decided is kept internal. Again, if your case is dismissed, that does NOT mean you have not experienced police misconduct.
