DUES CHECKOFF 
SECTION 2 -DUES CHECK OFF 
A. 1. The City will check off uniform and regular monthly dues as design ated by the FOP in writing to the City on the basis of individually sign ed voluntary check-offauthorization cards. This shall include deductions from compensation paid pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act, 53 P.S. 637 if the City has received a voluntary check­off authorization card signed by the employee specifically permitting the City to deduct dues from compensation paid pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act. A copy of such authorization card for the check-off of FOP dues shall be furnished to the City. These authorizations shall not be sent more frequently than once each month. Deductions on the basis of authorization cards submitted to the City shallcommence for the month in which the City receives such card or in which such card becomes effective, whichever is later. In case of earnings insufficient to coverdeductions, a deduction shall be made from the next pay in which there is sufficient earnings or a double deduction may be made from the pay of the following month, provided, however that any accumulation of dues shall be limited to two (2) months. 
2. If the FOP shall increase the amount of its monthly and/or annual dues subsequent to the execution of then current dues check-off authorization cards by members of the bargaining unit, the then current dues check-off authorization cards shall be considered sufficient authorization to the City to increase the amount of FOP dues deducted by it from the earnings of the respective members of the bargaining unit. 
3. Written notification from an appropriate officer of the FOP to the City that the FOP has increased its periodic dues shall be considered by the City as constituting adequate notice and authority for it to increase the amount of any dues deduction that it deducts from the earnings of members of the bargaining unit. 
3 
4. The City shall, at the direction of the FOP, make extra dues deductions from an employee who is in delinquent status. If an employee is absent from work for reasons other than those already provided for in this Agreement, the FOP may, when said employee returns to work, submit written notification to the City statingthe amount of dues delinquency and the number of months an extra dues deduction shall be taken from an employee's pay. 
B. The City shall remit to the FOP all monies deducted and a list of all employees for whom a deduction has been made on or before the I 5th day of the month after such deductions are made. 
C. The FOP shall indemnify and save the City harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reason of any action or inaction taken by the City for the purpose of complying with any of the provisions of this Section, or in reliance on any list, notice, or assignment furnished under any such provisions.

SENIORITY 
SECTION 3 -SENIORITY 
A seniority system based upon continuous service and applicable ability considerations shall be followed for employment security and work assignment determinations, to include annual "Job Pick" selections and awards of and to police service employees, during the term of this Agreement. In connection therewith, the following definitions and rules are to be applied by the City. 
A. Continuous Service -The "continuous service" status of each bargaining unit employee shall mean all "unbroken" service, from the date of his or her initial employment as a Police Officer in the Police Bureau. A break in such service will result, however, upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
1. 
voluntary quit; 

2. 
termination for cause; or 

3. 
absence in excess of five (5) days without any justifiable reason and/or without any "report off' from work within that period of absence. 

4. 
Any continuous absence due to a non-work related disability for a total of twelve 


(12) continuous months or for a total of twelve (12) cumulative months in a twenty­four (24) month period shall result in a break in continuous service and termination of employment. The period of absence runs prospectively from April 1, 2001. Any employee who is terminated under this provision for a non-work related disability will be able, within five (5) years following termination, to present evidence to the City physician establishing that the non-work related disability has been overcome, and that the former officer is able to return to full duty. In such case, the officer will be reinstated, and his continuous service shall be bridged for all purposes. 
B. Job or "Rank" Seniority -Each employee will be accorded job or "rank" seniority, from the date of his or her initial promotion to any rank, with his or her "continuous service" status therefore running from that date. Seniority for any lower ranks held by an employee will continue while he or she holds any higher rank, of any Police Officer job. In the event an employee is reinstated after having terminated employment, he or she shall be accorded full credit for all time served as a Police Officer in the Police Bureau. 
C. Bureau-Wide Seniority -Each employee will be accorded a "bureau-wide" continuous service or "seniority" status from the date of his or her initial employment on any job in the Police Bureau of the City. This seniority shall be applied in cases of any decrease in force and/or recall action affecting employees in his/her job or rank, by the City. 
D. Annual Bidding (Job Pick) Procedures -By September 15 of each calendar year, the Chief of Police shall forward to the FOP his projected manning level notice for the Bureau of Police for the following year. The FOP shall have the right to grieve in an expedited manner any issues concerning the proposed picks. The parties shall select a neutral arbitrator prior to September 15 to decide any expedited grievances so as not to delay the October 1 posting date. 
1. Uniform Division Employees 
a. By October 1, and continuing until October 31, of each calendar year, the Chief of Police shall cause a posting of Projected Manning Level notices indicating regular assignments and shifts to be filled by Uniformed Officers (including desk officers), and listing the names, ranks and service dates of such officers assigned, at and for all Police Stations maintained by the City. These notices shall include a "sign up" page or "Pick Sheet" for each position (by shift) to be posted and filled, at and for each such Police Station. 
6 
b. 
The Chief of Police shall have the discretion to create and post units within which qualified Uniformed Police Officers may bid, and place qualified Uniformed Police Officers within them. These positions are considered exempt. An exempt position is one which requires, or will require after appointment, training or ability that is not required for basic patrol assignments. The City will send to the FOP a written statement as to the qualifications it considers in placing employees in the units. The FOP shall have the right to a meet and discuss within 10 days of the receipt of the positing if it perceives the posting as an attempt to circumvent seniority or other "contractual" rights of Uniformed Police Officers. This shall not prohibit an Officer from filing a grievance to challenge their non-selection. 

c. 
In the event that the City-wide bidding process is not utilized for all positions in Operations in any given bidding cycle, then the twenty five percent (25%) most senior police officers (excluding sergeants and lieutenants) assigned to work in the uniform division each year shall be permitted to elect the zone in which they will work that year, in order of seniority. 

d. 
During the above said "posting" period, all Uniform Police Officers at each Station shall be given an opportunity to sign the Pick Sheet notice reflecting the regular "position" (and shift) of his or her choice. Any employee who fails to sign up for any regular position and shift assignment posted, or whose choice of position and shift is awarded to a senior employee, shall be assigned to one, without regard to his or her seniority status, by the Commander at the Station. 

e. 
All regular position and shift assignment selections under Paragraph B hereof shall be made and awarded on a "seniority" basis, from among all 


qualified Uniform Division employees at each Police Station. Any employee who fails to obtain his indicated choice of such assignments will be given a right to make a new choice within the posting period of Paragraph ( d) above, and will be considered therefore, on the same basis.  
f.  All employees assigned to Zones shall be permitted to bid on car, wagon, utility or COP assignments on the basis of seniority. Regular COP assignments shall be posted and shall indicate the two (2) consecutive pass days and the shift.  
g  By November 15 of each calendar year, the Chief will post Officer Assignment notices, indicating all regular positions assigned, by name, rank and applicable service date of each employee so assigned, at and for each Police Station, for the next following calendar year. A copy of this notice will be provided to the Local FOP President.  
h.  As provided in Paragraph (a)-(b) above, all Station assignments of Uniform Division ( and other) employees will be made by the Chief of Police.  
1.  If, after the assignments within a Police Station for a calendar year take effect, an opening in an assignment occurs due to a resignation, retirement, including disability retirement, death, or promotion which the City determines to fill, then the vacancy shall be posted for bid within the Police  

8 
Station or unit before transferring a Uniformed Police Officer from another Police Station or unit. The City may fill such openings at any time by posting for bid, but if the City gives the assignment to Uniformed Police Officers for thirty (30) calendar days then it will be deemed to have determined to post the opening for bid. The assignment and shift shall be posted for bid for ten (10) calendar days but otherwise the procedure for bidding shall be the same as under subparagraphs d and e above. Only the initial opening caused by one of the events described above shall be filled by this procedure. Nothing in this subsection shall force the City to make promotions. 
J. If, on a particular shift, the City must fill a vehicle assignment open on that shift, then the City shall fill it first from among Uniformed Police Officers who have successfully bid upon vehicle assignments but who have no vehicle available on that shift. If there are more open vehicle assignments on that shift than there are available Uniformed Police Officers who have successfully bid upon vehicle assignments, then the open vehicle assignments will be given to Uniformed Police Officers who successfully bid upon utility assignments, first by request, then by inverse order of seniority. The City may bypass any Uniformed Police Officer for an open vehicle assignment on a particular shift if the City, in good faith, believes that because of compatibility, the Uniformed Police Officer will not be effective in that assignment on that shift. 
k. Picks shall be made in the following order 
Lieutenants shall pick first. Sergeants shall pick second. Detectives shall pick third. Master Police Officers shall pick fourth. 4th Year Patrol Officers shall pick fifth. 
9 
3rd Year Patrol Officers shall pick sixth. 
2nd Year Patrol Officers shall pick seventh. 
1st 
Year Patrol Officers shall pick eighth. 
For seniority purposes in the Detective Bureau only, all persons assigned to the Detective Bureau prior to February 17, 1998 shall have their seniority based upon total service as a Police Officer. Any person permanently appointed to the Detective Bureau after February 17, 1998 shall have their seniority based upon time in grade as a detective. 
1. The City may, in its sole discretion, utilize an annual city-wide picking of shifts in the uniform division in order of seniority as is currently provided to the top 25% most senior officers and excluding lieutenants. Sergeants (in the uniform division) will be permitted to exercise their seniority to pick their duty location. The City will be permitted to move lieutenants for the "good of the bureau" as defined by the parties' arbitral history and/or for the purpose of enhancing the Bureau by utilizing/matching the individual skill set/abilities of a lieutenant with the needs of a particular work unit provided such assignment was not arbitrary or capricious. This change shall be done on a trial basis to provide the City with the opportunity to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the change to the staffing process. 
m. This trial period is for the October 2020 bidding process ( establishing January 2021 assignments) and may be reopened at any time by the City or the FOP for any reason by notice to the three members of the Board of Arbitration during April 2021 to include any aspect of the bidding process. 
This issue may be reopened by written notice by either Party to the Board Members during the month of April, 2021. 
2. Other Employees 
10 
A procedure similar to that described in Paragraph (a) --(b) above will be followed for regular position and shift assignments to employees "outside" of the Uniform Division. A separate such procedure may be established and applied to any reasonable " groupings" of such employees, as determined by the Chief of Police. 
3. Removal from Exempt Positions 
a. 
In the event that an exempt position is eliminated, reduced, or reorganized, removal will occur in order of inverse City-wide seniority. 

b. 
Removal from a specialized position for reasons other than as stated in subsection 


(a) 
above shall be for reasonable grounds. Notice of such removal shall be accompanied by a written explanation setting forth the reasons. If a member wishes to appeal such decision to remove, they may use the grievance procedures set forth in Section 5 of this agreement. 

c. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the City's right to transfer employees in accordance with Section 3(E). 


E. Transfers and Reassignments 
1. Permanent 
Permanent transfers of employees from their regular position or shift assignments, at any Station, will be made only with the consent of each affected employee, so long as the regular position and shift assignment selected by him continues to be manned at his Station, during that calendar year, by the City. 
2. Temporary 
Station, position and/or shift transfers or reassignments, including in the Investigative Branch, of any employee(s) for a period not to exceed ninety (90) in any calendar year -shall be deemed "temporary." Normally such transfers shall first be done through seeking volunteers and if an insufficient number of volunteers are available, then the transfers shall normally be made in inverse order of seniority. Such "temporary" transfers or reassignments are to be based upon Police service requirements, as determined by the Chief of Police. The Chief shall have an unfettered right to determine such requirements, and to make such temporary transfers or reassignments, during the period of this Agreement. However, no transfer under this paragraph may be made for disciplinary reasons. In the event of an emergency, the transfers may be made without first seeking volunteers or without reverting to the use of inverse order of seniority. If special skills or abilities are needed or if the transfer would result in overtime the transfer may be made without first seeking volunteers. 
3. Personal Transfers 
Any employee may request a transfer from one shift to another or one station to another within the Operations Division. All such requests shall be in writing with a copy to the FOP. Requests for transfer may be granted only for compelling personal reasons or inability to adequately perform assigned duties. Requests for transfer shall be granted provided there is a vacant position as determined by the City, available or another employee will consent to trade shift or station assignment with· the employee requesting the transfer and the employee is capable of performing the assigned duties of the new shift or station. In the event that more requests are received than may be accommodated, preference in granting such 
.transfers shall be based on length of continuous service. Final discretion as to whether or not a transfer is to be granted shall rest with the Chief. 
4. 
Bureau Transfers 

Employees may be transferred by the Chief, or their Commander, either temporarily or permanently, to another shift or station for the good of the Bureau. The City may transfer officers, for the good of the bureau, where events or circumstances, jeopardize the ability of the officers to safely perform the duties of their position, including pending litigation or disciplinary action. Bureau transfers, for the purpose of affording necessary police service, shall as far as practicable be in the reverse order of length of continuous service. Nothing in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection prohibits the City from transferring employees from their picked job assignments at one Police Station or unit to another police station or unit in accordance with this paragraph. 

5. 
Employees are to have two (2) weeks notice of permanent, involuntary transfers from any Police Station to another, except in the case of emergencies or as the needs of public safety require. 


F. Seniority Roster Postings -Two (2) separate Seniority Rosters will be posted at each Police Station, one (1) listing the names, ranks, service dates, station and shift assignments of all bargaining unit employees and the other listing the names, ranks, service dates and shift assignments of employees at that particular Police Station. The City shall supply to the Fraternal Order of Police, a seniority list in inverse order of seniority with dates of promotion to last rank and category within the Pittsburgh Police. Said seniority list shall be provided to the Fraternal Order of Police no later than June 1st of each calendar year. 
MANAGEMENT 
SECTION 4 -MANAGEMENT 
A. The City and the Director of the Department of Public Safety, through the Chief of Police shall have the exclusive right to manage, administer, and supervise the employees including the right to schedule and assign work, transfer, and the sole and exclusive right to determine the size and organization of the Police Bureau including the discretion to detennine vacancies and to fill vacancies in accordance with the needs of the Bureau and the public safety as detennined by the Chief of Police, Director of the Department of Public Safety, and the Mayor. 
B. The parties recognize that the procedure for appointments, promotions, and reduction of force, suspensions and discharges is as provided by the Police Civil Service Act for Cities of the Second Class as amended as of January 1, 1976 (53 P. S. § 23531 et seq.), and the City shall obey the safeguards outlined in Section 21 in conducting internal investigations. 
If the Legislature should, amend or enact statutes that mandate a process for the removal, discharge, suspension, reduction in rank or reduction in pay of employees in the competitive class then the collective bargaining agreement will be amended to reflect said changes. 
C. Except in an emergency situation, the Chief of Police, Deputy Chief, Assistant Chiefs and Commanders will notify and provide a copy to the FOP, at least 15 days prior to the implementation of any change in the Rules and Regulations of the Bureau, and any new General Order. This notice is to provide the FOP with a chance to review and, if desired, to discuss the order or regulation in question with Police Administration. 
14 
D. FOP Bulletin Boards shall be provided at all stations and divisions subject to normal City rules and regulations against inappropriate usage. 
E. The FOP shall be notified in writing by the City of any disciplinary action or actions taken by it against any member of the bargaining unit within seven (7) calendar days of such action. 
The Mayor of the City shall provide the President of the FOP with a copy of his proposed budget for the next fiscal year at approximately the same time that the Mayor submits such proposed budget to City Council. 
G. The FOP shall be notified in writing by the City of all new hires, promotions or terminations which occur within the bargaining unit, as well as any changes which materially affect the job status of members of the bargaining unit within fifteen (15) calendar days subsequent to such event. 
H. The City may, at its sole discretion, subcontract any work presently performed by the bargaining unit. The City will engage in meet and discuss with the FOP prior to taking any such action. 
15 
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

SECTION 5 -GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 
A. The parties shall observe and be bound by Public Law 1183 of 1947 relating to strikes by public employees. (43 P.S. § 215.1 et seq.). During the term of this Agreement there shall be no lockouts. There shall be no strikes, work stoppages, interruption, or impeding of work, or concerted absences from work. No officer, board member or representative of the FOP shall authorize, instigate, aid or condone any such activities. The applicable procedures of this Agreement shall be followed for the settlement of all grievances. 
B. DEFINITIONS 
Grievance -A "grievance" is hereby defined as: 
1. 
A complaint by an employee regarding the interpretation of application of, or compliance with this Agreement. 

2. 
A complaint by the FOP regarding interpretation or application of, or compliance with this agreement. 

3. 
Any disciplinary action resulting in discharge, suspension, written reprimand or demotion. The employee may elect to grieve any such disciplinary action to arbitration before a tripartite arbitration panel selected in accordance with the Police discipline appeals procedures of the contract. 

4. 
The days for the filing and processing of grievances shall be calendar days. 

5. 
The failure to process or answer a grievance within an established time limit presumes that it has been satisfactorily resolved. 

6. 
The parties may extend the specified time limits in writing. 

7. 
If the City fails to file a timely answer to a grievance, or the FOP fails to file a timely appeal to the next step, it will create a rebuttable presumption that the grievance is being settled by the party who fails to take timely action. 


16 
The parties, by mutual agreement, can expedite a grievance from Step 1 to Step 3. 
9. Disciplinary termination grievances shall take precedence over contract grievances. 
C. PROCEDURE 
1. Step One 
a. 
Any employee who believes that he (or she) has a grievance and is unable to resolve the matter personally, must first notify his (or her) Commander of the Grievance orally or in writing before submitting a written grievance to the Chief of Police, on forms provided by the City, which shall ( among other items) include the signatures of the Grievance or Assistant Grievance Committeeman and the employee. A copy of the written grievance must be contemporaneously provided to the Commander when it is submitted to the Chief of Police. 

b. 
To be considered, the written and signed grievance shall be submitted to the Chief of Police (or designee) within fourteen (14) days after the occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance or within fourteen (14) days after the employee knew or reasonably should have known of the event giving rise to the grievance. 


The FOP's representative and the Chief of Police (or designee) shall meet and discuss such grievances following receipt of the written grievance, at a meeting to be scheduled for such purpose at a time and place mutually agreeable to the parties. Such grievances will be discussed and answered 
17 
by the Chief within fourteen (14) days, after they are received. The Chief shall have authority to settle any grievance. 
d. 
The answer of the Chief ( or designee) and the date thereof shall be recorded on the Grievance Form, with a copy given to the aggrieved employee and to his/her FOP representative. If the Chief does not respond within fourteen 

(14) days, the grievance shall be considered granted, without necessity for further appeal. 

e. 
If a grievance is not satisfactorily resolved at Step One, it may be appealed to the Step Two level by the FOP filing an appeal in writing within fourteen 

(14) days of the Chiefs Step One answer. 

f. 
Information and documents shall be exchanged in good faith during the grievance process by the City and the FOP with the arbitrator retaining the sole discretion on admission of the documents for evidentiary purposes at the arbitration hearing. 


2. Step Two 
a. 
In Step Two, the FOP's representative and the Mayor (or designee) shall discuss such grievances, following receipt of the written appeal to the latter, at a meeting to be scheduled for such purpose at a time and place mutually agreeable to the parties. Grievances discussed in such meeting shall be answered by the Mayor (or designee) in writing, within fourteen (14) days after the date of such meeting, unless a different date for such disposition is agreed upon by the parties. If the City is unable or unwilling to meet within fourteen (14) days then the FOP may proceed to Step III without prejudice to the positions of either party. 

b. 
If the Step Two meeting is held, and if the Mayor's answer in Step Two is not appealed in writing within fourteen (14) days after the written answer by the Mayor (or designee) the particular grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of such decision, and shall not be eligible for further appeal. If the Mayor (or designee) does not answer within fourteen (14) calendar days, the grievance shall be considered granted, without necessity for further appeal. The resolution at this step shall be final and binding should a Party fail to meet the time period specified, with the grievance either being denied with prejudice or granted, with the remedy being implemented which is consistent with the relief requested by the FOP in the grievance and the contractual provisions at issue. 


3. Step Three 
a. Any grievance which has been processed in accordance with the provisions of this Section, but which has not been satisfactorily resolved may, upon proper appeal, be submitted to arbitration before an impartial Arbitrator to be selected from the list of impartial arbitrators established by the parties as set forth below. 
The City and the FOP shall each submit the names of twelve (12) arbitrators who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators. 
11. The first nine (9) names that appear on both lists shall comprise a permanent panel of arbitrators. 
111. Ifless than nine (9) names appear on both lists, all names that appear on both lists shall be on the permanent panel and the remaining names shall be combined into one list. 
1v. From the combined list of names, each party will alternately strike one name (the City shall strike first) until a total of nine (9) arbitrators have been selected overall.

HOURS OF WORK 
SECTION 8 -HOURS OF WORK 
A. This Section defines the normal hours of work, but shall not be construed, either, as a guarantee of hours of work and pay or as a basis for calculating overtime hours of work and pay, except as provided for, otherwise, in this Agreement. 
1. 
The normal workday shall be eight (8) consecutive hours of work. An employee shall be entitled to a meal period of one-half (1/2) hour while on duty during the eight (8) hour work period. It is understood that the employee is on duty and on call at any time during the meal period. 

2. 
The normal workweek shall be five (5) workdays beginning on the first day of any seven (7) consecutive day period which may begin on any day of the calendar week. Workdays shall be consecutive except for days off. The normal two (2) days off shall be consecutive days off. 

3. 
The normal workweek shall apply except in emergency cases for the suppression of riots or tumults or the preservation of the public peace in times of riot, conflagration, or public celebrations. 


B. Time spent by employees in attendance in Court and Magistrate sessions, including lunch breaks, as required by subpoena by the District Attorney's Office or as required by the Chief of Police, is time worked and shall be compensated as such. Such time worked shall be compensated at the regular rate or at the overtime rate, depending upon whether it qualified as straight-time or overtime, provided, however, that employees required to attend pretrial or Federal, State, County, or City Court and Magistrate sessions shall be guaranteed at least three (3) hours pay at the applicable rate. This paragraph shall also apply to Law Department and Human Relations Hearings, Merit Board, OMI interviews, 
27 
and in Trial Boards and Boards of inquiry for sitting members or witnesses for the prosecution. 
An officer who appears in court as a defendant in a civil or criminal case arising out of the performance of police duties may elect to have his shift changed to coincide with scheduled court appearances. An officer electing such change would waive any claim to overtime within a twenty-four (24) hour period in relation to his regularly scheduled shift. Subject to the approval of the County and the courts, an officer required to attend City Court must select either morning or afternoon schedule for court hearings. No election will be honored, however, if it would create a claim for overtime compensation that would not otherwise exist. 
C. An employee whose court appearance continues into the employee's shift shall be entitled to pay for time worked only. The three hour court appearance guarantee shall be inapplicable. 
An employee whose court appearance starts one and one-half hours or less prior to the employee's shift may be required to report for duty immediately after the court appearance and the three hour court appearance guarantee shall be inapplicable. 
If an employee's court appearance starts more than one and one-half hours prior to the employee's shift and ends prior to the employee's shift, the three hour court appearance guarantee shall be applicable whether or not the employee is asked to report to work immediately after the court appearance. 
If a court appearance occurs more than one and one-half (1 ½) hours after the end of an 
employee's shift, the employee shall be entitled to the three (3) hour court appearance 
guarantee whether or not the employee is held over until the appearance begins. 
28 
If a court appearance occurs one and one-half (1 ½) hours or less after the end of an employee shift, the employee may be held over for the court appearance. In this event, the employee shall be paid for hours worked only and the three (3) hour court appearance guarantee shall be inapplicable. 
An employee required to make two court appearances in a day may be held over on duty from the first to the second court appearance. In this event the three hour court appearance guarantee is applicable only to the first court appearance. 
Overtime hours accrued as a result of court time can, at the discretion of the officer, be paid 
as overtime or be banked as compensatory time subject to the rules and procedure set forth 
in Section 26. 
D. Call Outs -Except for Court or Magistrate sessions covered by Paragraph B above, an employee called out to work for any period other than the period of his or her previously scheduled hours of work shall be guaranteed at least four ( 4) hours of work or pay and shall be compensated at applicable overtime pay rates for such 'call out' time. Previously scheduled hours of work of any affected employee shall not be rearranged or reduced because of call out work under these provisions. 
E. Except in "emergency" situations, or where requested and agreed to by the affected employees, any change in previously scheduled hours of work shall be made and posted no later than Thursday of the week preceding the calendar week in which the change is to take effect, or by the end of the last shift worked by the affected employee during that preceding week, whichever occurs first. 
F. When any change is made in the schedule of, any employee in any manner contrary to the provisions of Paragraph E above, he/she shall be deemed to have reported for work on his regular shift and shall be paid on that basis, with all other hours worked on that day compensated for, at the appropriate "overtime" pay rate. 
29 
G. The Chief (or designee) may waive the "40 hour work rule" by permitting officers to accrue overtime after 8 hours of work during the work week encompassing a Special Event. For purposes of this Section a "Special Event" shall be defined to include: First Night, St. Patrick's Day (and related parades), Light Up Night, Independence Day, Regatta, Great Race, Marathon, Pride Fest, and Sports Championships. The Chief ( or designee) may also elect to waive the "40 hour work rule" up to six additional times per calendar year. 
This issue may be reopened by written notice by either Party to the Board of Arbitration during the month of April 2021. 
H. Shift differential -For hours worked on the afternoon shift there shall be paid a premium rate of 2.00% of the hourly rate; and for hours worked on the night shift there shall be paid a premium rate of 3.00% of the hourly rate; and for hours worked between 4:00 P.M. and 
11:00 P.M. there shall be paid a premium rate of 4.00% of the hourly rate. 
1. For purposes of applying the aforesaid shift differentials, all hours worked by an employee during the workday shall be considered as worked on the shift on which he or she is regularly scheduled to start work, except, 
a) An employee regularly scheduled for the day or afternoon shift who completes his or her regular eight-hour turn and continues to work into the following shift shall be paid the applicable shift differential for all hours worked on the following shift. 
An employee who completes his or her regular eight hour turn and after going off duty is called out for another shift within the same workday shall be paid the applicable shift differential if any, for the hours works on the other shift. 
2. Shifts shall be identified in accordance with the following: 
a) 
Day Shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence between 6:00 

a.m. and 8:00 a.m. inclusive.

4. 
Any hours worked by an employee on a regularly scheduled shift which commences at a time not specified in Paragraph 2 above shall be paid as follows: 

a) 
For hours worked which would fall in the prevailing day tum of the Bureau no shift differential shall be paid. 

b) 
For hours worked which would fall in the prevailing afternoon tum of the Bureau the afternoon shift differential shall be paid. 

c) 
For hours worked which would fall in the prevailing night tum of the Bureau the night shift differential shall be paid. 




For all hours worked by an employee during any shift which begins after 
4:00 p.m. and before 11 :00 p.m., the employee shall be paid a shift differential of 4.00% of the hourly rate. 
I. EXCHANGE OF PASS DAYS 
1. 
Employees assigned to the same station, division and of equal rank may exchange complete pass days and tours of duty, subject to the approval of the Assistant Chief and/or his Designated Representative 

2. 
No overtime liability due to such exchanges shall accrue to the City nor shall the City assume responsibility for enforcement or repayment of time between the officers involved. 

3. 
In no event are exchanges of duty tours to be granted in order for any employee to make profit or for the purpose of assuming outside employment of any length or duration. 


I. Nothing in the Award of December 30, 2004 shall be construed to change the present practice regarding minimum pay for court appearances. 




OVERTIME 
SECTION 9 -OVERTIME 
A. DEFINITIONS 
1. 
The workweek shall consist of seven (7) consecutive days beginning 12:01 a.m. on Monday. 

2. 
The workday is the twenty-four (24) hour period beginning with the time the employee begins work. 

3. 
The regular rate of pay as used in this Agreement shall mean the standard hourly wage rate which the employee would have received for the work assigned had it been performed during the 40 hour work week. 

4. 
For purposes of overtime payments, based on Wheeler v. Hampton,399 F.3rd 238 (C.A.3 (Pa.) 2005), the annual base pay will include longevity pay, and shift differential at the median rate, proposed by the City of three (3 % ) percent. 


B. Overtime rates of one and one-half (11 h) times the regular rate will be paid for: 
1. During any workweek wherein an officer actually works more than forty hours, the hours in excess of forty hours will be paid at a premium rate of one and one half times the officer's regular rate. Overtime hours accrued as a result of this provision can, at the discretion of the officer, be paid as overtime or be banked as a compensatory time subject to the rules and procedure set forth in Section 26. 
C. The City may not cancel a police officer's pass day on a non-emergency basis without first offering to fill the staffing need with another officer on a voluntary basis. The City may offer the opportunity to other officers in the zone or officers in other zones (including the reassignment of officers from plain clothes to uniform 
patrol) on a voluntary basis. An emergency shall be defined by Section 8 (A) (3). If officers are forced to work on pass days, then the order of selection shall be by inverse seniority. If officers are forced to work on pass days, then the order of selection shall be by inverse seniority. 
D. Payment of overtime rates shall not be duplicated for the same hours worked. Hours compensated for at overtime rates shall not be counted further for any purpose in detennining overtime liability under the same or any other provisions of this Agreement. 
E. Improper Absenteeism Exclusion 
Any employee who absents himself (herself) from work without penmss10n or justification, or whose pattern of absences otherwise demonstrates an abuse (it is to be noted that patterns of attendance abuse do properly subject an employee to discipline), and who does not challenge the determination that such absence(s) were made without permission or justification, under this Agreement, may be required to make up the time not worked, in four (4) hour periods, at any time and in any assignment directed therefore, by the Chief of Police. 
All "make up" work under this provision will be compensable on a "regular time" pay basis; provided that any affected employee be accorded an option to elect and accept a suspension penalty for periods not to exceed three (3) days and a fine in an amount not to exceed three (3) days' pay, in addition-in lieu of such make-up work-for each improper absence. Any unchallenged improper failure by the employee to "make up" any time lost, as directed by the Chief, shall be deemed an election and acceptance of a suspension penalty and fine under this Section. 
Any election and acceptance of such suspension penalty and fine under this provision 
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any right to protest that suspension penalty and 
fine, under any City or State Law or Agreement provision in effect at the time. 
34 
F. All shift changes shall occur on the first of each month. The first eight (8) hours worked on the first day of a new schedule shall be compensated at straight time. 
G. The existing DCOP-17-060 Memorandum, dated March 25, 2017, shall be continued with amendment to include NROs. This issue may be reopened by written notice by either Party to the Board Members during the month of April, 2021. 
H. OVERTIME PAY AND ACTING PAY OPPORTUNITIES 
Whenever the need arises to hire on over time a lieutenant or sergeant ( and on-duty manpower is not available), hire the person of the rank to be filled if the cost is the same as hiring a lower rank to act in a higher capacity. (Thus, the practice will continue of making a lower rank act in a higher capacity, as long as it is not on overtime and the cost is only acting pay.) 
2. 
As long as the lieutenant or sergeant who is offered the overtime is not on pass, this will prevail. A lieutenant or sergeant who is on pass is free to volunteer to work at time and a half, provided he/she agrees notto demand the overtime rate applicable for pass day work. This in no way creates a mandatory manning level, and the Bureau will continue to have a lower rank act if on-duty manpower is available. 

3. 
Offers will be made consistent with the terms ofDCOP-17-060. 

4. 
When there is an opportunity to offer an acting duty assignment to a lower ranking officer, officers who are currently on the active promotion eligible list for the rank to be filled will be offered the opportunity. Where there is no current or valid promotional list, the City may utilize any officer that it deems qualified to fill the temporary vacancy. 

5. 
If this procedure is violated by anyone under the rank of Commander, there will not be any grievances accepted by the FOP, and the City will notbe required to pay any amount to the lieutenant/sergeant who was not offered the overtime.

B. HEALTH INSURANCE 
I. Active Police Officer Health Insurance 
1. a. The City will continue to offer the current two health care plan designs, the Basic Plan ("Next Generation PPO 90/10 Plan") and Premier Plan (mirroring the current 2019 benefits provided to active fire fighters, regardless of future changes in the Fire Plan). The police plan benefits shall not change because the Fire Fighter's Plan changed. 
b. Effective January 1, 2019, police officers shall contribute sixteen and one­half (16.5%) percent of the annual cost/ premium for health insurance, vision care and the dental plan. The calculation of the employee contribution of 16.5% shall be in accordance with the prior arbitration awards of Arbitrator Jane Desimone (10/5/2018), Arbitrator Michael 
Zobrak (3/22/07) and Arbitrator John Skonier (12/30/2004); while self­insured, the trending and fluctuation margins/fees shall not be applied in determining the annual cost/premium nor shall there be a surcharge such as the 2% levied in the past. 
The City has the right to purchase fully insured health care plans and to continue the 16.5 percent of actual premium charged or to self-insure for the purposes of health care coverage. 
d.  It is recognized that the City will make annual adjustments to the contribution amounts based upon the calculation as set forth in paragraph b ( of Section 14(B )(I)( 1) above)  
e.  The FOP may utilize the grievance procedure to challenge the amount of any annual adjustment.  
f.  The City has the right to purchase fully insured health care plans or to self-insure for the purposes of health care coverage.  

The City shall have the right to change the existing medical, surgical, and hospitalization insurance plan, which is comparable to the coverage presently being provided.

If the FOP does not agree that a plan selected by the City is comparable it will so state, in writing, to the City within fourteen (14) days of the plan being provided to the FOP by the City, or such longer period as mutually agreed to by the parties. In that event, the City may not unilaterally implement the proposed new plan, however, it may immediately process the dispute before a neutral arbitrator selected pursuant to the arbitration step of the grievance procedure. The decision of the arbitrator on this comparability issue shall be issued within forty-five (45) calendar days of the FOP's written notice contesting that the plan selected by the City is comparable and shall be final and binding and will determine if the City is authorized to implement a new plan. 
If the City receives notice or information indicating that its health care plan costs will subject the plan to the Affordable Care Act's "Cadillac Tax" excise tax, the City will give the FOP written notice of that fact and the parties will immediately meet to discuss changes in the plan design, plan and/or plan carrier in order to avoid the imposition of the tax. If no agreement is reached within fourteen (14) days of the City's written notice to the FOP regarding this issue, then the parties will proceed to an expedited arbitration proceeding with an arbitrator selected pursuant to the terms of the Working Agreement's grievance and arbitration procedure. The sole purpose for that expedited arbitration proceeding will be for the arbitrator to modify the plan, plan design and/or plan carrier in order to eliminate the exposure to the Cadillac Tax. The decision of the arbitrator on this issue shall be issued within forty (40) calendar days of his or her appointment.
