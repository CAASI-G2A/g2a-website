in an arbitrary or capricious manner contrary to this Agreement or established policies
or practices governing or affecting the Officers covered by this Collective Bargaining
Agreement, and/or (3) the filing by the Borough of a formal written reprimand.
In those areas in which the Borough has management rights, the exercise
of said rights without consultation with the members of Police force or their

HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE

A

The Borough shall provide each employee the option of the Highmark MBS
PPO Blue 01500 Plan or the UPMC MBS PPO Q1500 plan, a high
deductible-health insurance plan that has no patient co-pays provided,
however, that the Borough shall also self-insure all applicable plan
deductibles and cause such deductibles to be promptly paid in full.
- 10 -

Effective January 1, 2019 each covered employee shall contribute seven and
one-half percent (7.5%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage
selected and starting July 1, 2019 the employee contribution will increase to eight
percent (8%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage selected.
Effective January 1, 2020, each covered employee shall annually contribute eight and
one-half percent (8.5%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage
selected. Effective January 1, 2021, each covered employee shall annually contribute
nine percent (9%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage selected.
Effective January 1, 2022, each covered employee shall annually contribute ten percent
(10%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage selected.
Employee contributions to premium shall be contingent upon continued subscription by
the Borough to a health-insurance plan that has no patient co-pays and for which the
Borough self-insures all applicable plan deductibles. Employee contributions to health
care insurance premiums shall be made bi-weekly, on a pro rata basis, by means of
pre-tax payroll (IRC Section 125) deductions.

The Borough retains the right to change plans or carriers for the purposes of

the proposed new plan and identify and proposed new carrier, is given to the Union in

costs will subject the plan to the Affordable Care Act's "Cadillac Tax" excise tax, the
employer will give the Union written notice of that fact and the parties will immediately
negotiate changes in the plan design, plan and/or plan carrier in order to avoid the
imposition of the tax. If no agreement is reached within fourteen (14) days of the
employer's written notice to the Union regarding this issue, then the parties will proceed
to an expedited interest arbitration proceeding in accordance with Act 111. The sole
purpose for that expedited arbitration proceeding will be for the arbitration panel to
modify the plan, plan design and/or plan carrier in order to eliminate the exposure to the
Cadillac Tax. The decision of the arbitration panel on this issue shall be issued within
thirty (30) calendar days of appointment of the neutral arbitrator.

- 11 -

B.

accounts will be retained and frozen. If the borough resumes or maintains health
insurance coverage for the officer which requires payment by the officers of a
deductible, the subject provisions will be reinstated.

E.

for each Officer so that the employee may access these funds for payment of medical
expenses incurred by the Officer, his/her spouse or dependents in accordance with

will be retained and frozen. The retired Officers may access these amounts during their
retirement in order to meet actual medical expenses incurred by the retired Officer,

only during open enrollment periods in December of each year to be entitled to
coverage for the following year. Special provisions will be made for an employee who
has a significant change in status such as a spouse who dies, a divorce, a marriage,
child birth, or such other major change during the calendar year in which they have
opted to decline insurance coverage, subject to COBRA regulations.
K.
Retirees shall, at their option, be covered with the Borough's Highmark
PPO Blue Q1500 medical plan with the same terms and conditions as covered
employees or a comparable plan from a new carrier. Retirees shall make arrangements
with the Borough to make their payment contribution on a monthly basis. The Borough

from the time that said Officer retires at age 55 or older until he is eligible for Medicare
coverage under the Social Security program, at which time said Officer shall apply for
Medicare coverage and will no longer be covered under the Borough's plan. In the
event of an Officer's spouse becomes eligible for Medicare as of her own right, then the

new carrier from the time that the said Officer retires at age 55 or older until he reaches
the age of 65.

J

M.

Agreement for maintenance in force for each retired Officer and his family, for the vision
care plan provided by Municipal Employers Insurance Trust or a comparable plan from

the age of 65.

N.
With respect to any health insurance and major medical coverage, and

Police Pension Plan fund and shall be paid for from the pension fund at no cost to either
the Association of Bellevue Police or the Borough of Bellevue.

of the Chief of Police in consultation with the Education Officer and concurred in by the

The Borough shall make every effort to avoid requiring a Police Officer to work
immediately prior to or immediately subsequent to attendance at either a Mandatory
Police Training Class or up to two Approved Training Classes annually on those days
that an Officer is scheduled work. This shall not apply in the case of an emergency. All
days of Mandatory Police Training time and up to two days of Approved Police Training
time shall be counted as duty time for overtime calculation purposes and shall be paid
