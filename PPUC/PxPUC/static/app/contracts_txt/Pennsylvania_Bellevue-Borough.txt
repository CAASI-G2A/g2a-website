deductible-health insurance plan that has no patient co-pays provided,
however, that the Borough shall also self-insure all applicable plan
deductibles and cause such deductibles to be promptly paid in full.

-10-
Effective January 1, 2019 each covered employee shall contribute seven and
one-half percent (7.5%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage
selected and starting July 1, 2019 the employee contribution will increase to eight
percent (8%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage selected.
Effective January 1, 2020, each covered employee shall annually contribute eight and
one-half percent (8.5%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage
selected. Effective January 1, 2021, each covered employee shall annually contribute
nine percent (9%) of the premium cost for the applicable level of coverage selected.

employer's written notice to the Union regarding this issue, then the parties will proceed
to an expedited interest arbitration proceeding in accordance with Act 111. The sole
purpose for that expedited arbitration proceeding will be for the arbitration panel to
modify the plan, plan design and/or plan carrier in order to eliminate the exposure to the
Cadillac Tax. The decision of the arbitration panel on this issue shall be issued within
thirty (30) calendar days of appointment of the neutral arbitrator.

deductible, the subject provisions will be reinstated.

for each Officer so that the employee may access these funds for payment of medical

child birth, or such other major change during the calendar year in which they have
opted to decline insurance coverage, subject to COBRA regulations.
