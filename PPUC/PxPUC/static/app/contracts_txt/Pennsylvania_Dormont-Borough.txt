as part of the final pay for the month of October in each calendar year. On Christmas

because of illness may be required to submit to the Chief of Police a Physicians’
certificate verifying that such absence was due to illness and said employee is physically
fit to return to duty. In addition, the Borough reserves the right to have any employee
who has been off work three (3) or more consecutive days due to an alleged illness
examined by a physician of the Borough’s own choice. In the event that the Borough
exercises its option to have such an employee so examined, said employee shall not be
permitted to return to duty until the Borough’s physician certifies that he/she is physically
fit for duty. Any employee failing to submit the aforesaid Physician's certificate within
seven (7) days after returning to duty or who refuses to be examined by the Borough’s
physician shall not be paid for the days he/she was absent. An employee qualifying for
the aforesaid sick leave benefits shall be paid an amount equal to the regular salary he/she

10
would have been paid had he/she worked for each day the employee was absent due to
illness,

5. Each employee shall be advised in writing by February 28 of each
year as to his/her total accumulated sick leave.

sick day shall require that the employee notify the Police Desk of the nature of the
problem necessitating the use of the sick day. In addition, a telephone number will be left
with the Police Desk so that a contact point is had for the employee. Should the
employee be required to leave his/her home or hospital, he/she will notify the Police
Desk of the fact. The employee will also grant access to any visiting supervising Officer
at any reasonable hour and fully and accurately inform him/her of the nature of the illness
of injury.

8. An employee on extended disability as of the first of the calendar
year shall not receive the annual grant of sick days until he/she is certified by a physician
for return to full duty.

9. In the event that an officer utilizes more than fifteen (15) sick days
in a calendar year, without providing a Physician’s certificate of illness, the officer shall
forfeit his entitlement to collect the annual longevity payment the following year. Any
sick days taken during the year for which the officer provides a Physician’s certificate of
illness shall not count towards the fifteen (15) day benchmark identified in this
paragraph. For example, an officer that uses seventeen (17) sick days but provides a
Physician’s certificate of illness for three (3) of the days shall be deemed to have used
fourteen (14) sick days for purposes of the annual sick day/longevity waiver discussed in
this paragraph no. 9.

Borough, and by reason thereof is temporarily incapacitated from performing his/her
Borough duties, shall be paid by the Borough his/her full rate of salary. During that time,
salary for temporary incapacity shall be paid by the Borough. Any worker’s
compensation received or collected by any such employee for such period shall be turned
over to the Borough, and if such payment shall not be made by the employee, the amount
so due the Borough shall be deducted from any salary then or thereafter becoming due
and owing. An officer who is receiving Heart and Lung Benefits is receiving his full
salary, based upon a regular schedule. Therefore, the officer will not be paid overtime for
training or court time or for attending a meeting with the Borough during regular business
hours. These duties will be part of the officer’s regular schedule while on Heart & Lung
Benefits.

F, INSURANCE
1. Off-Duty Long Term Disability

a. The Borough shall provide an insurance policy for the employees
providing off-duty long term disability benefits whereby an
employee who is injured off the job or suffers an extended illness
shall receive, after a ninety (90) day waiting period, a benefit
equivalent to two-thirds (2/3) of his/her base pay. The Borough
shall assume 100% of the cost of that benefit. It is agreed that any
policy provided shall contain the provision that any benefit amount
due is payable until the death of the employee or age sixty-five
(65), whichever occurs first.

b. It is understood and agreed that an employee cannot receive both
the sick leave pay from the Borough and the benefit provided by
the Borough under the aforesaid disability policy for the same
periods of time. During any such overlapping periods, the
Borough shall deduct from the employee’s pay an amount equal to
the benefit which he/she is entitled to receive under the aforesaid
insurance policy.

c. It is agreed that an employee cannot use any of his/her

accumulated sick time if he/she is injured during the course of
secondary, non work-related employment.

The Borough of Dormont may, in order to reduce costs or cost
increases, change plans and/or carriers to “substantially
comparable” coverage. “Substantially comparable” coverage in
this contract does not mean equal or equivalent. The union
however, retains the right to grieve the Borough’s determination
that a plan and/or carrier is “substantially comparable.” When the
Borough decides to change the plan or carrier, it will provide the
union with details of the current plan and the new “substantially
comparable” plan. Ifthe union does not agree that the plan or
carrier selected by the Borough is “substantially comparable,” it
will so state, in writing, to the Borough within fourteen (14)
calendar days of the plan and/or provider being presented to the
union by the Borough, or such longer period as mutually agreed to
by the parties in writing, identifying the reasons. In that event, the
Borough may not unilaterally implement the proposed new plan
and/or carrier provided; however, it may immediately process the
dispute before a neutral arbitrator selected pursuant to the
arbitration step of the grievance procedure. The decision of the
arbitrator on this “substantially comparable” issue shall be issued
within forty-five (45) calendar days of the union’s written notice
contesting that the plan selected by the Borough is “substantially
comparable” and shall be final and binding and will determine if
the Borough is authorized to implement the new plan or provider.

b. The Borough shall also provide high-option Dental Plan coverage
for the employee and their families. The Borough will pay Twenty
Dollars ($20.00) per employee per month toward said plan. The
Borough will pay one-third (1/3) of the remaining cost and the

necessary to cover the employees as follows: Life insurance of Fifty Thousand Dollars

leave of absence in excess of 30 days. For example, the lump sum payment for holidays

period that the police officer was on a leave of absence in excess of thirty days.

IV. WORKING CONDITIONS

A. SENIORITY

The parties agree to accept the principal of seniority in respect to the picking of
predetermined schedules and vacation. After six (6) months of continuous service with

14
the Borough, each employee shall have seniority within their respective job classification
(Police Officer or Police Sergeant). Seniority credit is within rank or grade and cannot be
transferred between job classifications as it applies to the picking of schedules, vacations
or the eligibility of shift work or shift overtime.

Call out rights will be based on total length of continuous Police service with the
Borough.

All other aspects of seniority (e.g. longevity, accrued vacation time and accrued
sick leave time) shall be by the total length of service regardless of job classification with
the Borough.

B. SCHEDULING

itis agreed that all scheduling will be unique to the job classification. A work
schedule will be established by the Chief of Police in which the available shifts and
corresponding pass days for that shift will be clearly indicated. Each scheduling period
will commence and end on the following rotation:

1. First Monday in January until the Sunday before the first Monday
in April.

2. First Monday in April until the Sunday before the first Monday in
July.

3. First Monday in July until the Sunday before the first Monday in
October.

4. First Monday in October until the Sunday before the first Monday

in January.

The Chief of Police will determine what shifts to post, including pass days.
During each three (3) month scheduling period, pass days will rotate within each shift.

The Chief of Police will post the available schedule one (1} month before the end
of each preceding period. Each employee shall be contacted and directed to pick an
available shift. All contacts, requests, and picks will be done via seniority within the job
classification from most senior officer to least senior Officer. If an employee fails to pick
a shift schedule within three (3) working days from the direction of the Chief of Police,
that employee will forfeit all seniority rights for schedule selection within the job
classification for that scheduling period.

The posted shift schedules will adhere to the following guidelines:

1. All shifts will have two (2) consecutive days off within the work week.

15
2. The Chief of Police will at all times attempt to schedule sixteen (16) hours
off between shifts. The only exception to this guideline will be when
denied manpower exceeds the available personnel or when the employee
is working an overtime shift.

3. Switching hours will be permitted between employees. Switching of
entire rotations is prohibited. The responsibility for the coverage of a shift is always the
responsibility of the employee who is originally scheduled to work that shift.

It is agreed that Police Officers will report for duty and be able to commence
working fifteen (15) minutes before the regular scheduled hour for them to report to
work. Police Officers will be granted forty-five (45) minute lunch periods each shift.

Cc. ASSIGNMENT OF OVERTIME

i. For the purposes of determining the assignment of overtime, three (3)
daily work shifts are established with respective hours of each shift:
Shift A: 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM
Shift B: 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM
Shift C: 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM

If a shift other than those enumerated above now exists or is established in the
future, assignment will be made to one (1) of the three (3) enumerated shifts based on the
time allocation of the majority of hours of the odd shift within the three (3) daily work
shifts. For example, a shift established from 8:00 PM to 4:00 AM will be identified as
part of Shift C, since five (5) of the hours worked on that shift fall within the 11:00 PM to
7:00 AM time block for Shift C. If an odd shift was to be created so that the hours
worked were split evenly between two established shifts, assignment to a shift will be at
the discretion of the Chief of Police.

All overtime assignments shall be offered in accordance within the shift and by
seniority as follows:

When additional work must be performed on any shift or when an employee is
absent and cannot work his/her regular work shift due to disabilities caused by accident
or illness, the necessity to appear in court as a witness, death in the family, or approved
leave of absence, and a substitute is needed, the call out procedure will be completed in
the following order:

1 Dormont Policemen on a pass day but working the same shift.

2. Dormont Policemen on a pass day but net working the same shift.

3 Dormont Policemen not on a pass day and working other shifts, on
a straight seniority basis.

16
4, Splitting the shift into four (4) hour segments and offering it to
officers pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above.

In the event that none of these methods allow the shift to be filled, the
Borough shall have the right to hold an officer over from a preceding shift.

2. During vacation periods, it is understood that Police Officers will work
their regular pass days when scheduled by the Chief of Police.

3. The Borough reserves the right to schedule overtime for 4 hour periods at
any time.

4. If an emergency situation occurs, such as a fire, bad accident or any other
such occurrence that poses a threat to the public safety, heath or welfare, it is agreed that
any employee may be assigned to abate the situation regardless of whether the work is
overtime of not, irrespective of seniority.

5. If an employee is called by telephone and an answering machine is
contacted, a message will be left on the machine and the next appropriate person will be
contacted for overtime, If the next person is contacted and accepts before the previous
employee returns the call after receiving his/her message on the answering machine, the
succeeding person is awarded the overtime assignment. If, however, the first person calls
before the succeeding person accepts, then the first person is awarded the overtime.

6. If contact is made for an overtime assignment and that opportunity is
refused and then a second opportunity occurs, the next senior person will be contacted.
The first denial will be deemed a denial for all successive opportunities and there will be
no repetition of calls to inquire about interest in successive overtime during that shift.

7. Any posted overtime shall be filled a minimum of 72 hours before the start
of the overtime shift. If there are less than 72 hours remaining when an overtime shift
becomes available, it shall be filled immediately. The provisions for calling officers in
Item 5 of the Assignment of overtime shall be followed when filling the overtime to meet
the 72 hour provision, Any officer who is aware of posted overtime may make
Supervisors aware in the advance that he/she will take the overtime if the opportunity to
work that overtime comes down to him/her. If an officer takes advantage of this
opportunity to leave notice of intent to take overtime, it is that officer’s responsibility to
see if he/she was awarded the overtime to be present on duty if they were,

D. WORK WEEK

The work week shall start at 7:00 AM Monday.

17
E. SHIFT REQUIREMENTS

The Borough shall have the inherent managerial prerogative to determine the
number of officers in the Department, the number of officers assigned to a shift, and
whether officers absent from a shift will be replaced. The Borough shall not be required
to have any number of officers on a shift, nor shall it be required to have a particular
number of officers of any rank on a shift. The minimum staffing requirements set forth
in prior collective bargaining agreement has been eliminated.

1. The Chief of Police shall work Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to
3:00 PM. If two (2) overtime spots are created on any given shift due to officers being
off of work, the Chief of Police may elect to fill one of the spots on his own. This shail

Chief of Police will be posted in advance. Any interested officer will have the
opportunity to sign up and present his qualifications to be considered for that
school/training.

The Chief of Police will make the final decision concerning all training
assignments, and the Chief’s decision shal! not be subject to the Grievance Procedure and
Arbitration Provisions of the Agreement. If an Officer does not sign up for training, the
Chief may still assign that Officer for training. If there is not sufficient time to post the
training opportunity in advance, the Sergeants/OICs on duty will call Officers to find out
if they are interested.

G. SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS

Special Assignments will be defined as those assignments that result in regular,
recurring, O.T., that require some specialized training to perform, including, but not
limited to: DARE Officers, DANET/Drug Task Force, Crime Scene Technician, etc.

Assignments, and the Chief’s decision shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure
and Arbitration Provisions of the Agreement. The Association agrees that seniority is not
a factor in determining Special Assignments.

A.

PENSION AND RETIREMENT

The parties hereto acknowledge that the Borough has provided for a Police
Pension Fund under Ordinance No. 1457. All Police Officers shall be
covered by said pension fund. It is the intention of the parties that the
Police Pension Plan shall be in compliance with Act 600, as amended, and
as it may be amended in the future,

The final average monthly salary of said pension is to be calculated on the
basis of the employees’ last thirty-six (36) months of employment.

The normal monthly retirement benefit shall be equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the employee’s final monthly average salary.

Employees shall be eligible for normal retirement after twenty-five (25)
years of service and attainment of age fifty (50).

There shall be a survivor’s benefit equal to fifty percent (50%) of the
participant’s benefit, payable to a surviving spouse for the remainder of
the spouse’s life. If there is no surviving spouse or if the spouse dies, the
participant’s children will share the benefit until the age of eighteen (18),
or until age 23 if attending college (minimum of seven credits per
semester).

There shall be a provision for one hundred percent (100%) vesting after
twelve (12) years of service, so that an eligible participant would receive a
benefit at normal retirement equal to their accrued benefit, which would be
defined as fifty percent (50%) of the final monthly average salary
calculated at the date of termination, multiplied by the ratio of completed
service to date of termination over service to normal retirement.

An Officer who shall incur a total and permanent disability, which is a
direct result of, and which occurs in, the line of duty of employment, shall
receive a disability retirement benefit in an amount equal to 50% of the
Officer’s salary at the time the disability was incurred, provided that any
Officer who receives a disability retirement shall have his/her disability
benefits offset or reduced by the amount of any benefits received for the

19
same injury under the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. §301 ef
seq.).

An additional service increment benefit shall be added equal to Twenty
Dollars ($20.00) per month for each completed year of service in excess of

twenty-five (25) with a maximum increment of One Hundred Dollars
($100.00).

If the pension plan should need the contributions of the Police Officers to
remain actuarially sound, it is agreed that Police Officer contributions, to
the legal maximum if necessary, can be required before the Borough
would have to make contributions to the police pension plan from its
general revenues. It is also agreed that before such contributions are
required of the Police that the Borough would allocate all of the Act 205
monies coming into the Borough from the Commonwealth because it has a
police department with a police pension plan. Except in those
circumstances, the Borough remains free to allocate its Act 205 monies
pursuant to the authority and requirements in act 205. The Borough and
the Association have agreed that Police Officer contributions to the
pension plan shall be seven percent (8%).

Each employee who shall retire and receive a retirement benefit shall be
entitled to receive a cost of living adjustment to the amount of benefit
payable to the employee exclusive of any service increment benefit. Such
cost of living adjustment shall be determined on an annual basis by
applying a multiplier which is the version of the national CPI-U generally
held to most accurately measure the “market basket” of goods and services
bought and sold and shall not exceed any of the following limits: (1) the
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners
and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the year in which the participant was
last employed as an employee of the employer; (2) the total retirement
benefits payable under the plan shall not exceed seventy-five percent
(75%) of the employee’s final monthly average salary; (3) the total cost of
living increase shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the participant’s
retirement benefit under the plan; and (4) the cost of living adjustment
shall not impair the actuarial soundness of the Pension Plan.

The parties hereto also agree that the Borough will pay to each employee
who retires after the effective date of this Agreement the sum of Three
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($350.00) per month toward the purchase of health
insurance coverage. An employee shall not be eligible for this payment if,
after retirement, he/she obtains outside employment that provides health
insurance coverage, or has health insurance through his/her spouse’s
coverage. An employee must obtain health insurance coverage to be

20
eligible for said payment. Said payments shall continue until the
employee is eligible for Medicare.

L. The Killed in Service benefit has been assumed by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and the Borough shall no longer provide any benefit for an
officer killed-in-service.
