DISCIPLINE

Section 1. Probationary Period

and regulations, incompetency, and inefficiency without action of a Court-Martial Board, the right
of appeal to a civil court, or the grievance procedure.

Section 2. Suspension Without Pay

A member shall not be suspended without pay unless the conduct falls within the purview of
the Governor's Code of Conduct or the Confidence in Law Enforcement Act, or the member is
notified of dismissal after selecting the grievance procedure or recommendation for probationary
review.

In disciplinary cases that could reasonably be construed to result in termination other than
those referenced in the above paragraph, the Department shall limit suspensions without pay
pending investigation of the conduct to no more than 20 working days. If, upon expiration of the
20 working day period of suspension without pay, the Department has not completed its
investigation, the member shall be placed on suspension with pay, be returned to restricted duty
status, and/or be temporarily reassigned or transferred to a reasonably situated station or
assignment, until such time as the Notice of Disciplinary Penalty has been issued. The Department,
at its discretion, may elect which of these options to utilize in any given case. The use of these
options by the Department shall not prevent subsequent disciplinary action from being taken, and
any subsequent disciplinary action shall not constitute double jeopardy; nor shall the use of these
options be used as a defense in any subsequent disciplinary proceeding.

22
Nothing in this Section shall be construed to impose temporal or other limits on the
Department’s right to impose suspension without pay as a form of disciplinary penalty.

Section 3. Fringe Benefits During Suspension Without Pay

In accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), a member who is
suspended without pay for any reason shall continue to receive the benefits provided under the State
Police Health Program, the State Police Supplemental Benefits Program, and the Group Life
Insurance Program during the period of suspension until the 92" day of the suspension.

Should the ACA be repealed or amended during the term of the Agreement, a member who
is suspended without pay who has not been charged with a felony or misdemeanor under the laws of
the United States, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, any other state(s) of the United States, and/or
subdivisions thereof, shall continue to receive the benefits provided under the State Police Health
Program, the State Police Supplemental Benefits Program, and the Group Life Insurance Program
during the period of suspension until such time as the cost of the benefits paid equals the amount of
the member's accumulated retirement deductions and interest, plus the amount of all eligible leave
payouts; at such time, the above benefits will terminate. If the member elects not to file a grievance,
or the grievance is denied wholly or in part, for any reason, the member shall reimburse the
Commonwealth for the cost of the benefits within 90 days of the final disposition or upon separation
from the Department, whichever shall occur sooner. The member will be required to repay the
Commonwealth for the cost of such benefits as follows:

a. For the State Police Health Program and the State Police Supplemental Benefits
Program, the member will pay the monthly individual or multiparty premium that is
charged to COBRA subscribers during the period of the suspension, minus the 2%
administrative charge;

b. For the Group Life Insurance Program, the member will pay the monthly contribution
rate that the Agency would have paid during the period of suspension.

Such premiums will be paid whether or not any actual claims were incurred during
the period of the suspension.

Should the ACA be repealed or amended during the term of the Agreement, suspensions of
members who have been charged criminally with misdemeanors or felonies under the laws of the
United States, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, any other state(s) of the United States, and/or
subdivisions thereof, shall be reviewed by the Office of Administration on a case-by-case basis, in
consultation with the PSTA and the Department, as necessary, to determine whether benefits will
continue in accordance with the provisions of this Section. A decision will be rendered as soon as
possible, but not later than 20 working days from the date the Department is notified of the filing of
charges in the case of a member who has been charged criminally with a felony or work-related
misdemeanor and not later than 20 working days from the date the Department notifies the member
that the member is being suspended in the case of a member who has been charged criminally with

23
a non-work-related misdemeanor. If the aforementioned time limits are exceeded, benefits will
continue in accordance with the provisions of this Section. The determination of the Office of
Administration will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.

Benefits during suspensions of one full pay period or less shall be processed in accordance
with the current practice.

to name, one of the three members of the Court-Martial Board.

predisposition conference, DAR issuance, or any hearing.

C. Absent exigent circumstances, the member shall receive reasonable notice to arrange

reasonable time period. However, this does not give the interviewee the right to a specific
representative, only to one that is nearest and most readily available.

d. Any member who is interviewed in regards to an investigation and has reason to
believe that their statements could result in administrative action being taken against them, shall be
afforded PSTA representation if requested.

e. A member, prior to the issuance of a DAR, shall be afforded the rights under Article
28, Section 2 of the grievance procedure.

subject of the investigation. In cases involving multiple subjects of investigation, the tape recording
shall be furnished within 15 working days after the last interview is completed. During tape recorded
interviews, members shall also be permitted to simultaneously tape record the interview consistent
with those procedures jointly agreed to between the parties.

g. Upon the issuance of a DAR, the PSTA shall be given all information, evidence,
reports and statements obtained by the Department related to the charge or charges; provided,
however, that the Department shall not be obligated to turn over any information, evidence, report
or statement that may compromise, interfere with, or otherwise impede any other investigation by

24
another law enforcement agency or the Pennsylvania State Police, including for example the names
of confidential witnesses.

No later than 15 calendar days prior to any arbitration hearing, the Commonwealth and the
Union shall exchange (1) all available information, evidence and all complete statements, to the
extent created in the course of preparing the case, for any person who may testify; and (2) the
names of all persons who will testify including a statement of the subject matter of each witness’s
testimony.

If any of the above has not been exchanged, it may not be used by the non-producing party
at the hearing; provided, however, that information which was not available or was discovered
after the deadline for exchange of information may be used if it has been provided to the other
party as soon as possible after discovery.

h. The Department Disciplinary Officer may only take action on those elements of
misconduct which are designated as “sustained” in the DAR.

the involved incident in writing and direct it to their Commanding Officer or other designated

said correspondence. If further information/ clarification is subsequently required, the member shall
be given specific questions to be answered.

to court-martial proceedings, alleged violations of the Governor's Code of Conduct, or cases in which
a prosecutorial determination is sought, the Department shall complete its investigation and the
member advised of the Troop Commander/Bureau Director's notice of administrative findings within
120 calendar days. The 120 calendar days will commence on the date the member is notified of the
complaint, except as provided below:

advised of the Troop Commander/Bureau Director's notice of administrative findings

25
within 120 calendar days of the date the Department is notified of the complaint.

45 calendar days of the member's selection of the grievance procedure.

(1) The Department Disciplinary Officer shall seek to issue a Notice of
Disciplinary Penalty, if any, in all non-court-martial cases within sixty (60)
calendar days of issuance of the DAR, but in no case shall such notice be
issued more than ninety (90) calendar days from issuance of the DAR.

(2) The Department Disciplinary Officer shall seek to issue a Notice of
Disciplinary Penalty, if any, in all court-martial cases within ninety (90)
calendar days of issuance of the DAR, but in no case shall such notice be

suspension without pay may be initiated. However, the time limits may be waived
by the Department upon a showing of just cause or by mutual agreement of both
parties.

Except in cases alleging criminal conduct or cases which give rise to court-martial
proceedings, no disciplinary action consisting of a suspension without pay shall be imposed for
violations of Department rules and regulations which are discovered more than one year after the
date of occurrence unless mandated by the Governor's Code of Conduct. This paragraph shall not
apply upon a showing of proof that the member acted to prevent such discovery.

official personnel folder and Troop/Bureau personnel file shall be purged within 30 days of the
findings and all purged material returned to the member. Unfounded, not sustained, policy void, or
withdrawn investigations shall not be used for consideration in evaluations or specialized position
selections.

All other purging shall be in accordance with established practice.
Section 9. Receipt of Complaints

citizen complaint, shall complete a complaint verification and shall request the complainant's

denied in writing at STEP 1 and appealed to STEP 2 and matters of discipline grieved directly to
STEP 2. A list of grievances to be discussed shall be sent to the Bureau of Labor Relations'
representative and the Director, Bureau of Human Resources, Pennsylvania State Police by the
PSTA Grievance Board Chairman, within seven calendar days, when possible, prior to the grievance
committee meeting. All amendments of grievances, if any, shall be done at the meeting of the
grievance committee.

STEP 3. If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved by the grievance committee at
STEP 2, the grievance may be scheduled for arbitration by the PSTA Grievance Board Chairman by
serving upon the Bureau of Labor Relations' representative notice, within 10 calendar days of the
grievance committee meeting, of its intent to proceed to arbitration. The Bureau of Labor Relations
representative and the PSTA Grievance Board Chairman shall determine hearing dates and arbitrator
availability.

The Employer's decision at STEP 1 and the Committee's decision at STEP 2 shall not be
used as a precedent for any subsequent case.

Section 4. Grievance Processing

An aggrieved member and PSTA representative, if member, and a reasonable number of
witnesses, when required, shall be granted reasonable time during working hours, if required, to
process grievances in accordance with this Article without loss of pay or leave time.

Section 5. PSTA Representation

The PSTA must have an opportunity to appear with the grievant at all steps of the grievance
procedure. Subsequent to the issuance of the Disciplinary Officer's letter of adjudication the PSTA
shall have the right to investigate all issues not incorporated within an investigation against a
member, provided the issue has been brought to the attention of the Department and the Department
chooses not to investigate the issue. Such follow-up investigation shall occur during off-duty hours,
a member's badge of office shall not be used, and any expenses incurred therewith shall be borne
exclusively by the PSTA.

Section 6. Grievance Resolution

The PSTA Grievance Board shall have the authority to settle, amend, or withdraw any
30
grievance which does not have merit, does not comply with the time frames stated previously above,
or does not comply with the guidelines established by the PSTA.

Section 7. Arbitrator and Site Selection

Five neutral arbitrators are to be selected by the parties jointly to hear cases in the above
procedure.

Either party may, at any time, remove a neutral arbitrator, selected by the parties, after giving
the other party at least 15 days’ notice.

When a vacancy exists on the list of arbitrators, the parties should attempt to agree on a
replacement within 10 calendar days. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall request the
American Arbitration Association to submit a list of seven arbitrators. Upon receipt of such list, the
parties shall alternately strike until one arbitrator needed to fill a vacancy remains. A new list shall
be requested from the American Arbitration Association for each arbitrator to be selected. Only one
arbitrator is to be selected from each list. The Commonwealth shall strike first.

The parties may mutually agree to schedule a hearing at a location agreeable to both. For
discipline grievances, the hearing site will be at a neutral location within the geographical area of the
Troop where the grievance arose, unless mutually agreed otherwise.

When the parties cannot agree to a hearing location due to a disagreement over the nature of
the case, then the hearing site will be decided by the neutral arbitrator.

Section 8. Arbitrator Responsibility

Issues concerning timeliness or procedurally defective cases or matters on arbitrability will
be decided prior to hearing the merits of the grievance. The arbitrator shall neither add to, subtract
from, nor modify the provisions of this Agreement or of the arbitration awards. The arbitrator shall
confine himself/herself to the precise issue submitted for arbitration and shall have no authority to
determine any other issues not so submitted to him/her. In those matters involving discipline for
actions specifically set forth in Article 26, Section 12, Appendix CE, Subsections [1] - [12], the
arbitrator shall be limited to determining just cause and may not alter the penalty imposed by the
Department.

The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties. The arbitrator shall
be requested to issue his/her decision within 30 days after the record is closed, but not to exceed 60
days.

If briefs are to be submitted, they must be postmarked within 15 working days of the hearing
or the arbitrator shall decide the case without the late party's brief.

31
All of the time limits contained in the Article may be extended by mutual agreement. If the
Commonwealth fails to respond in a timely manner in any step of the grievance procedure, the
grievant and/or the PSTA may process the grievance to the next Step in the procedure.

All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the parties. Each
party shall bear the cost of preparing and presenting its own case. Either party desiring a record of
the proceedings shall pay for the record and make a copy available without charge to the arbitrator.

Section 9. Heart and Lung Claims

Matters dealing with Heart & Lung shall be addressed in AR 4-4 as agreed to. Subsequent
changes in AR 4-4 Heart & Lung Procedures shall be subject to bargaining. Grievances arising from
the grant or termination of Heart & Lung Act benefits shall be subject to the Grievance Procedure
specified in this Article.

Section 10. | Reimbursement/Compensation Issues

All issues dealing with the application of compensation and reimbursement under FR 4-1,
Loss of or Damage to State Property or Equipment, and FR 5-1, Travel & Subsistence, as presently
written or modified by the Department, shall be submitted to a Board made up of one representative
from the Department, one from the Office of Administration and one from the PSTA. The findings
of the Board shall be final and binding for Loss of or Damage to State Property or Equipment
involving $250 or less. In all other cases arising under this Section, the decision of the Board shall
be subject to the Grievance Procedure specified in this Article, except that grievances should be
submitted directly to Step 2.

It is understood by the parties that the Board/Aybitrator shall have no authority to amend the
Commonwealth's travel regulations.

Section 11. Grievance/Court-Martial Procedure Selection

In the event a member is accused of an offense that would otherwise be subject to court-
martial proceedings under Article 26, he/she shall be advised as follows:

Subsequent to the issuance of a DAR by the Troop Commander, if the Disciplinary Officer,
with the concurrence of the Deputy Commissioner of Administration and Professional
Responsibility, directs that the member be court-martialed, the following shall apply for
the selection of either court-martial procedure or grievance procedure:

a. The member will receive written notice (form) that he/she may elect to
challenge the accusation either through the court-martial procedure or the
grievance procedure within seven calendar days. When made, the election
shall be irrevocable. If not made in a timely manner, it shall be conclusively
presumed that the member has elected the grievance procedure.

32
b. The written notice (form) will state no matter which procedure the member
selects, he/she is subject to disciplinary action up to and including but not
limited to dismissal, transfer, reduction in rank and/or potential suspension in
excess of 30 days.

C. If the member selects the court-martial procedure, a request will be made of
the Governor to convene such proceedings at which time charges and
specifications will be issued, in writing, to the member.

d. If the member selects the grievance procedure, the Commissioner will
determine the appropriate penalty, and a written notice will be issued to the
member stating the disciplinary action to be taken and the underlying facts in
support thereof in accordance with the timeframes in Article 26, Section 7.c.
(2). After receiving the Commissioner's decision the normal grievance
procedure will then apply.

Section 12. Penalty Imposition

Subject to the provisions of Article 26, Section 5, Subsection g., a penalty of suspension
without pay shall be implemented at any point in time following receipt of the Notice of
Disciplinary Penalty by the member accused of misconduct. The implementation of the penalty
can be delayed upon mutual agreement of the parties.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Sections 11 and 12 herein above, where removal
from duty is required at any time due to the nature of the offense, the Department may suspend a
member in accordance with Article 26, Section 2.

Section 13. Administrative Leave

Administrative leave shall be for the time that coincides with the grievant's or witnesses’
work schedule, not to exceed a full shift. On the day of the hearing, the grievant/witness shall be
scheduled on a day shift (a shift for which shift differential is not paid). For this accommodation, no
overtime can be charged by the grievant/witness in respect to other sections of this contract.

A grievant and/or witnesses, when required to travel a distance exceeding 100 miles from
his/her regular station to the arbitration site, shall not be required to work a shift commencing after
8:00 a.m. the day prior to the arbitration hearing date unless a clear and present danger/emergency
exists.

All witnesses granted administrative leave time shall be required to testify unless excused
mutually by the parties.

33
Requests for administrative leave shall be presented in writing to the Office of
Administration, Bureau of Labor Relations, at least 14 days prior to the arbitration hearing date,
except for unforeseen circumstances, in which case leave shall not be unreasonably denied.

Up to five members appointed by the PSTA to serve on the Grievance Board shall receive
sufficient time to review grievances and attend STEP 2 Grievance Committee meetings without loss
of leave or compensation. It is agreed that all members appointed by the PSTA shall be active
members.

Section 14. Annual Review

The Commonwealth and the PSTA shall meet yearly to review the grievance procedure. The
procedure can be modified at any time by agreement between the parties.

Section 15. Agreement

The foregoing represents the parties' entire agreement with regard to Article 28, Grievance
Procedure, and any previous side-letters concerning this Grievance Procedure Article are no longer
in effect.

Section 16. Definitions
The term member shall include probationary Troopers except where excluded.

Section 17. Expedited Arbitration Procedure

In any case where (1) a disciplinary penalty has been imposed on a member following
service of a Notice of Disciplinary Penalty, and (2) the PSTA has made a written demand for
arbitration to the Commonwealth’s Bureau of Labor Relations within 10 calendar days of service
of the Notice upon the PSTA, the matter shall be heard before an arbitrator or a court martial board
within 61 calendar days following the date that the grievance was discussed at STEP 2 of the
grievance procedure in accordance with Section 3 of this Article. In the event the matter is not
heard within that time period, and the delay is not attributable to the PSTA or the member, the
penalty must be rescinded until such time as an arbitrator sustains the penalty. Delays attributable
to the member or PSTA, including the failure to make a demand for or to schedule the arbitration,
shall not result in rescission of the penalty. Should the PSTA not make a written demand for
arbitration within the ten day time period, the right to arbitration shall be deemed to have been
waived.

To implement the 61 day requirement, the parties shall immediately appoint a panel of
arbitrators to be designated as the Disciplinary Arbitration Panel. The appointments shall be made
in accordance with Section 7 of this Article. The Disciplinary Arbitration Panel shall consist of
not less than seven arbitrators, which number may be expanded as the parties deem necessary to
satisfy the sixty-one day requirement. Each arbitrator shall provide the parties with a minimum of

34
one date per every calendar month. Arbitrators appointed to the Disciplinary Arbitration Panel
shall serve two-year terms, but in no event shall an arbitrator be removed from the Disciplinary
Arbitration Panel without the mutual concurrence of the parties, prior to a date 24 months after the
arbitrator’s last appointment to the Panel. An arbitrator sitting on the Panel shall render his or her
decision within 10 calendar days of the close of the hearing. Written summations shall not be
accepted from either party without the consent of the other. Should written summations be
submitted, they shall be received within 10 days of the hearing, at which point the hearing will be
deemed closed. In the event that notes of testimony are taken by a reporter, the parties shall direct
that the notes be transcribed and forwarded to the parties and the arbitrator on an expedited basis
and in no event more than 48 hours after the close of the evidentiary hearing. A written opinion
may be required of the arbitrator by either party and, if required, shall be submitted within 30
calendar days of the close of the hearing.

ARTICLE 29
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE

Section 1. For any interest arbitration, contract negotiation or preparation therefore under Act
111, all members of the PSTA negotiating committee (limited to a maximum of 15 persons) and

shall provide reasonable notice of the request for such leave to the Employer. Travel time shall be
included in the requests.

Section 2. The President of the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association or his designee shall
have reasonable time off to handle and process grievances or other labor relations matters with
representatives of the Commonwealth. The President or his designee and necessary witnesses shall
be permitted to use administrative leave to attend a hearing before the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board. Any witnesses must actually testify before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board or be excused from testifying by mutual agreement. A witness, when required to travel a
distance exceeding 100 miles from his/her regular station to the site of the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board hearing, shall not be required to work a shift commencing after 8:00 a.m. the day
prior to the hearing date unless a clear and present danger/emergency exists.

Section 3. No more than three duly elected representatives (which shall include officers and
committee members) of each Fraternal Order of Police Lodge will be permitted to attend three
two-day "Round Robins" in the year, without loss of pay, plus one-half day travel for distances
exceeding one-hundred (100) miles, when verified on the request by the Troop Commander.

Section 4. A committee (numbering no more than seven members) may be designated by the
Pennsylvania State Troopers Association to meet two times a year with the State Police
Administration to discuss the Field Regulations Manual. The purpose of the meeting shall be to
provide the State Police Administration with information and suggestions concerning Field
Regulations. The proper utilization of this information is a matter for the State Police Administration
to determine.

35
ARTICLE 30
UNION BUSINESS

Upon request by the PSTA, Union officers shall be released from duty. Union officers
released from duty pursuant to State law shall be paid by the Commonwealth at the amount
designated by the PSTA Board of Directors, not to exceed the rate of the highest ranking member
of the bargaining unit with appropriate longevity. Any amount paid by the Commonwealth,
including the cost of all benefits, shall be reimbursed by the PSTA to the Commonwealth in
accordance with law.

ARTICLE 31
PERSONNEL FILES

Members shall have access to their personnel files in accordance with the State Police
Administrative Regulation 4-8.

ARTICLE 32
CLOTHING MAINTENANCE

An allowance of $500 is granted to all members (uniformed and non-uniformed) for the
purpose of clothing maintenance. Effective July 1, 2011, the clothing maintenance allowance shall
be $600. This allowance is in addition to clothing benefits now enjoyed by members. Payment is
to be made at the discretion of the Commonwealth except that at least one-half is to be paid during
the first six months of the contract year.

ARTICLE 33
OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT

Section 1. Members will be permitted to engage in outside employment under appropriate
circumstances. Outside employment shall not be limited to hardship cases and may take place
provided:

Prior authorization is obtained.

b. The scope of employment does not demean the image of the Pennsylvania State
Police.

There is no conflict with the member's primary duties.

d. The total amount of employment does not interfere with the member's ability to
perform his/her duties properly.

36
Section 2. If a member submits a request for authorization to engage in outside employment,
the State Police Administration shall endeavor to respond to the request within one week. If the
member does not receive a reply within 30 days, the request shall be deemed to be granted.

ARTICLE 34
REDUCTION IN FORCE

Section 1. In the event of a reduction in force, members will be laid off in accordance with the
inverse order of seniority on the basis of rank. If an officer (Corporal or above) is subject to layoff,
the person with the least seniority in that rank will be laid off first. That officer will then be permitted
to use his/her time as an officer for bumping into a lower officer classification. On the basis of
his/her Service Seniority he/she may bump into the rank of Trooper. The least senior Trooper will
then be laid off. Recall will be in the inverse order of the layoff. This provision must be administered
in accordance with any judicially imposed requirements.

Section 2. Service Seniority for the purpose of layoff shall be computed as continuous service
from the date of enlistment. Where two or more persons have the same date of enlistment, the
seniority rank will be on the basis of the highest to lowest enlistment scores.

ARTICLE 35
MEMBER TREATMENT

Section 1. The Employer agrees not to engage in or permit discrimination or harassment
against any member on the basis of race, creed, color, ancestry, sex, marital status, age, national
origin, disability, union membership, union activity or political affiliation.

Section 2. Incidents which are at variance with this principle may be appealed through the
grievance and arbitration procedure. In cases of alleged harassment, the only remedy available to
the arbitrator shall be a cease and desist award.

If a subsequent alleged harassment arbitration involving the same parties results in a cease
and desist award, the member who has committed the act of harassment shall be subject to
progressive discipline by the Department. Further substantiated acts of harassment shall result in
more severe discipline.

ARTICLE 36
TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT

When a member is temporarily assigned the duties of a higher rank for five days or more in
any calendar quarter, then the member shall receive, retroactive to the time the assignment took
place, the difference between his/her regular rate of pay and the rate he/she would receive had he/she

37
been promoted to that rank. This amount will be in addition to the member’s regular rate of pay. If
the member works the majority of hours on a shift, it shall be considered as a whole day at the higher
rank.

For the purpose of this Article, the calendar quarters shall be defined as beginning with the
first full pay period in January through March 31, April 1 through June 30, July | through September
30, and October 1 through the last full pay period of the leave calendar year, which is the pay period
that includes December 31.

ARTICLE 37
SPECIALIZED POSITIONS AND TRAINING
Section 1. Definitions
a. For the purpose of this Article, a specialized position is one designated on

Troop/Bureau rosters as of January 1, 1997 which requires special training or ability that is not
required for basic patrol unit assignments whether the specialized position assignment is performed
on a permanent or part time basis.

b. Exclusions to this Article are those specialized positions/assignments offered to all
members on a rotational basis, Area/Troop/Section/Station Commanders, Bureau/Division
Directors, Regional Commissioned Officers, positions under the Executive and Administrative
office, and positions under the Bureau of Integrity and Professional Standards. Also included in
these exclusions are those members assigned to Executive Services.

Section 2. Posting

a. Prior to posting a Specialized Position Vacancy, the Troop Commander/Bureau
Director has the option to offer the vacancy to members already serving in that same specialty
within the Troop/Bureau. The offer shall be made to all incumbents within the specialty via an
email from the Troop Commander/Bureau Director or designee. Incumbents will be given seven
(7) calendar days to respond by submitting a transfer request for the vacancy. The Troop
Commander/Bureau Director reserves the right to not transfer an incumbent due to operational
reasons. The reasons for such action must be provided to the incumbent member(s) in writing
within ten (10) calendar days of the Troop Commander’s/Bureau Director’s decision. In such
cases, the vacancy shall be posted in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.d.

If the transfer option is used and more than one incumbent in that specialty within the
Troop/Bureau submits a transfer request for the same vacancy, the senior member will receive the
transfer. If multiple vacancies exist, choice of vacancies will be offered by seniority. Seniority for
these purposes shall be the member’s total time served in the specific specialty in the
Troop/Bureau. If a tie still exists, the member who was sworn in earliest as a Trooper will be
considered the most senior. If a tie still exists, the random number provided by the Department
will be applied as a tie breaker.

38
The Troop Commander/Bureau Director has the option to continue to offer any subsequent
specialized position vacancies created as a result of such transfers until such time as no incumbents
submit a transfer request. At that time, any remaining vacancies will be filled by posting a Circular
and completing a selection process.

The aforementioned procedure does not apply to specialized position vacancies if an
incumbent Alternate(s) exist. When an incumbent Alternate(s) exists, the procedure described in
Section 3.c. shall be used to fill the vacancy.

b. For purposes of career development or temporary workload requirements members
may be assigned by the Troop Commander/Bureau Director to a 90 day rotation into a specialized
position. At the conclusion of the 90 day period, if the Department wishes to keep the position
filled, either a new member must be assigned to a 90 day rotation or the position must be posted
and filled in accordance with this Article.

C. Vacancies for all specialized positions (with the exception of Section 2.a. and 2.b.)
shall be posted electronically on the iNet for a period of at least 15 calendar days prior to the
selection process. During this time, qualified, interested members who have completed a minimum
of three years as an enlisted member may express their interest in the position.

d. All postings shall contain a job description, any special qualifications or
requirements, the skills and abilities to be evaluated and the fact that particularized judgment may
be exercised. Where the appointing officer exercises particularized judgment in filling specialized
positions, that judgment will not be overturned unless it is shown to have been abused or based on
unlawful criteria.

e. A copy of all postings shall be electronically forwarded to the PSTA at the time of
posting.

Unless there are operational reasons for not filling the position, the posted position shall be
filled from among the applicants deemed qualified through the selection process. Within 30 calendar
days after the completion of the selection process, PSTA will be notified if the posted position will
not be filled.

Section 3. Eligibility

a. Any member who has been suspended within one year of the posting of a specialized
position or who has been removed from a specialized position in accordance with Section 7.c. of this
Article shall not be eligible to apply unless a standing list is being created. When a standing list is
being created, such members may apply but may not be selected until the one year period or
mandatory time limit, as applicable, has expired. Members who have completed a minimum of
three years as an enlisted member may express their interest in a specialized position. When a
standing list is being established, members who have completed more than two years as an enlisted

39
member may apply for the position. However, such members will not be eligible for selection from
the standing list until such time as they have completed three years as an enlisted member.

b. A member who has been notified that a preference transfer has been approved is
not eligible to be selected for a specialized position at the Troop he/she is departing. A member
may apply for a specialized position at their new Troop if the transfer effective date falls within
the posting period.

C. Vacancies for specialized positions with incumbent Alternates shall first be filled
from members in those Alternate positions in the Troop/Bureau. If a single Alternate exists, no
posting is necessary unless the member declines the vacancy. If multiple Alternates exist, a posting
must be done (in accordance with Section 2.d.), but eligibility is restricted to current Alternates.
The normal selection procedure will then be used to select one of the Alternates for the vacancy.

If the selected Alternate works at a minimally staffed station or other operational
limitations exist, release to the full time position may be delayed until the next Intertroop transfers
occur.

d. Members on limited duty are eligible to apply for specialized positions. However,
such members must be released to full duty status by the SPMO prior to completion of the selection
process. Absent a release to full duty status by this deadline, the limited duty member shall be
deemed ineligible for selection. In the case of a standing list, limited duty members will remain on
the list, but will not be eligible for selection until after their release to full duty status.

e. The Department shall determine the qualifications necessary for each specialized
position vacancy posted through a Circular. Experience from a source outside of PSP that involves
a license or certification, as well as post-secondary educational credits, may be considered when
determining if an applicant meets these qualifications. Other sources of experience from outside
PSP will not be considered when determining if an applicant meets these qualifications. However,
such experience can be considered during the Assessment of Training and Experience component
of the selection process provided the member is deemed to be otherwise qualified for the specialty
in question.

f. Members in restricted duty status shall not be eligible to apply for specialized
positions.

Section 4. Reduction in Position

a. Removal from a specialized position in a Troop/Bureau because of a reduction of
personnel in that position or elimination of the specialty shall be by least seniority in that specialty
in the affected station, unit or work locations providing all factors are equal.

b. Removal from a specialized position for reasons other than as stated in subsection
a. above shall be for reasonable grounds. Notice of such removal shall be accompanied by a

40
written explanation setting forth the reasons. If a member wishes to appeal such decision to
remove, he/she may use the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in Section 10 of this
Article. If a removal is for disciplinary purposes, the issue in the case shall be whether the
Department had just cause for removal. Ifa removal is for non-disciplinary purposes (for example,
performance in or non-suitability for the position), the issue in the case shall be whether the
Department had reasonable grounds for removal.

C. When a member, who holds a specialized position, is in a status that precludes
him/her from performing the duties of that position for a period of eight weeks or more (e.g. limited
duty, disability leave, sick leave, leave without pay, etc.), he/she shall be placed in an inactive
status in regard to the specialized position. The member will remain in an inactive status until
he/she is released to full duty status by the SPMO. The Department reserves the right to issue a
Circular for an Alternate to the specialized position on a temporary basis to ensure operational
efficiency. The member selected to the Alternate position will perform the specialized position
duties of the member that was placed in an inactive status, until such time as that member is cleared
by the SPMO to return to full duty status. NOTE: Circulars to fill such Alternate positions on a
temporary basis shall include language confirming that assignment to the position shall end on the
date the inactive member returns to full duty status and that the Alternate position will be
abolished. The member assigned to the Alternate position will return to his/her previously held
position/duties. In the event the member in an inactive status leaves the Department, the member
selected to the Alternate position will be placed into the full time position on a permanent basis.

Section 5. Non-Selection Notification

Where a standing list is used, the appointing officer shall, within 30 calendar days, provide
a written explanation to each of the members who did not qualify to be placed on the list. Where a
standing list is not used, the appointing officer shall, within 30 calendar days, provide a written
explanation to each of the non-selected members setting forth the reasons for non-selection.

Section 6. Selection Procedure

a. A Troop Commander/Bureau Director may choose either a standing list or to post
vacancies on an as-needed basis.

b. When a standing list is established, it shall be posted within 10 calendar days after
the compiling of the list. The list shall stand for a period of one year or until the list is exhausted,
whichever comes first. The member with the highest absolute score in the selection process shall be
selected.

C. Absolute score shall be calculated to the nearest whole number.
d. Seniority will be the determining factor in tie breaking only when absolute scores are
identical.

41
e. Seniority standing for selection purposes shall be the date the member was sworn in
as a Trooper when considered for a _ position as Trooper, Trooper/Corporal or
Trooper/Corporal/Sergeant. For postings requiring rank or ranks higher than Trooper, seniority will
be the date the lowest required rank was obtained.

f. Where score and seniority are tied, the random number provided by the Department
will be applied as a tie breaker.

g. If no members apply for a specialized position vacancy or no members score high
enough to qualify during the selection process, the Troop Commander/Bureau Director may
appoint a member to fill the vacancy. No selection process is necessary in this situation, although
a written test should be administered to ensure the selected member is qualified. In cases of
Corporal or Sergeant vacancies, the position may be filled through the promotion process with the
concurrence of the Commissioner.

Section 7. Required Time Limits

a. Unless otherwise specified in the posting, all specialized positions will carry a
minimum time limit of three years which members are required to serve in the specialty.

b. Exceptions to mandatory minimum time limits for specialties are promotion,
retirement or removal from the position.

C. An incumbent may request removal by submitting an SP 3-201 to a Troop
Commander/Bureau Director which thoroughly outlines the reason for requesting removal from the
position. The final decision to grant or deny removal rests with the Troop Commander/Bureau
Director. The incumbent thus removed is ineligible to apply for another specialized position for the
duration of the mandatory time limit remaining since appointed or one year from the date of removal
from the position, whichever is less.

Section 8. Selection Process

a. A selection panel for all Bureau issued Circulars shall consist of a commissioned
officer and a non-commissioned officer, from the Bureau, selected by the Bureau Director. The
final member of the panel shall be selected by the PSTA President. If the posting is for a Trooper
only, this selection shall be a Trooper from the Bureau. If the posting is for a Corporal or Sergeant,
this selection shall be a member from the Bureau of equal rank to the highest rank in the posting.
NOTE: If a Sergeant is not available to serve on panel for a Sergeant vacancy, a Corporal that is
not in the direct chain of command may be selected. If this selection is not made within 14 calendar
days of receiving the request, the Bureau Director shall make the appointment. In the event a
selection cannot be made within the Bureau, the PSTA President shall seek the concurrence of the
Bureau Director to select a member from outside the Bureau.

42
b. A selection panel for all Troop issued Circulars shall consist of a commissioned
officer and a non-commissioned officer, from the Troop, selected by the Troop Commander. The
final member of the panel shall be selected by the local Board of Directors member, or his/her
designee. If the posting is for a Trooper only, this selection shall be a Trooper from the Troop. If
the posting is for a Corporal or Sergeant, this selection shall be a member from the Troop of equal
rank to the highest rank in the posting. NOTE: If a Sergeant is not available to serve on panel for
a Sergeant vacancy, a Corporal that is not in the direct chain of command may be selected. If this
selection is not made within 14 calendar days of receiving the request, the Troop Commander shall
make the appointment. In the event a selection cannot be made within the Troop, the local Board
of Directors member shall seek the concurrence of the Troop Commander to select a member from
outside the Troop.

C. The selection process shall consist of the following:

1. A written test consisting of relevant subject matter to the specialty. A
maximum of 10 points applied. A member must receive at least seven
points to receive further consideration in the selection process.

2. Interview process. A maximum of 10 points applied to entire process.
Questions used during the interview process shall be scored individually

determine the total number points applied for the interview process.

3. Assessment of training and experience. A maximum of 10 points applied.
4, Evaluation of performance. A maximum of 10 points applied.

The evaluation shall be by at least two immediate supervisors who has
supervised the member for at least 90 days. Whenever possible, the

H shall be used for scoring purposes. The specific dimensions to be
evaluated can be revised on this form based upon the specific requirements
of the position being filled.

5. When appropriate, a demonstration of ability relative to the position. A
maximum of 10 points applied.

6. In cases where the “demonstration of ability” factor is used, the applicant

limited number of members in a specialty or unit shall be electronically posted at all affected work
locations for a period of at least 15 calendar days prior to selection of amember to attend. A member
who has been notified that a preference transfer has been approved is not eligible to be selected
for specialized training at the Troop he/she is departing. Such members are eligible to apply for
specialized training opportunities at the new Troop if the effective date of the transfer falls within
the posting period. Selection of commissioned officers to attend training is at the discretion of the

received the same or equivalent training previously, or (2) has not attended special training within
the past 180 calendar days, or (3) received a suspension within one year of the selection. Seniority
shall be time in the specialty or unit in the Troop/Bureau. If seniority is tied, the tie breakers shall
be time in rank. If a tie still exists, the member who was sworn in earliest as a Trooper will be
considered the most senior. The random number provided by the Department will be applied as
the final tie breaker, if necessary.

c. If a member grieves and is awarded the training, the member shall attend the next
available training that is equivalent or similar to the training grieved.

d. Members in restricted duty status shall not be eligible to apply for training under this
provision.

six months) and he/she is not provided transportation, he/she shall receive a travel allowance equal
to the IRS rate applicable in Pennsylvania for all miles in excess of 50 miles (driven miles) per day
from his/her place of residence to his/her station and return.

Section 2. If a permanent involuntary transfer results in a subsequent involuntary transfer (the
permanent transfer lasting for less than six months) the above allowance shall be applicable
retroactively to the member.

Section 3. a. Except as provided in b. below, when an involuntary intratroop transfer must
be made, the member to be transferred must be the member who has the least seniority in his/her
rank in that station (provided he/she has not been moved involuntarily in the previous six months)
except in cases of promotion, in conjunction with the imposition of discipline or where there is a
need for special skills or specialty.

When the least senior member is transferred under this Section, the Department shall not be
required to consider the seniority of any member concurrently or subsequently transferred into that
station.

b. Irrespective of seniority, the Department, on a temporary basis, can involuntarily
transfer a member intratroop when the member is the subject of an EEO, administrative or criminal
investigation which brings the member into actual conflict with other personnel at the work location
to the extent that it would interfere with the function of the work location. For the duration of such
involuntary transfer, should the distance between the member’s place of residence and his/her station
be greater than 25 miles, the member shall be provided with transportation or a travel allowance
equal to the IRS rate applicable in Pennsylvania for all miles in excess of 25 miles each way.

ARTICLE 48
LEAVE DONATION PROGRAM

Section 1. The Commonwealth will implement and administer a Leave Donation Program.
Members may donate annual and personal leave to a designated member in the member’s
bargaining unit who has used all accrued and anticipated paid leave for the current leave calendar
year. The leave is to be used for the recipient’s own catastrophic or severe injury or illness or for
the catastrophic or severe injury or illness of a family member. The leave also may be used as
bereavement leave if the member’s family member dies and the member has no accrued or
anticipated sick leave available, subject to the limitations in Article 14, Section 3.

Section 2. Recipients
a. Recipients must be members in the bargaining unit.

b. Family member is defined as a husband, wife, child, step-child, foster-child or
parent of the member or any other person qualifying as a dependent under IRS eligibility criteria.

C. A catastrophic or severe illness or injury that poses a direct threat to life or to the
vital function of major bodily systems or organs, and would cause the member to take leave
without pay or terminate employment, must be documented on a Family and Medical Leave Act
Serious Health Condition Certification form. Donated leave may not be used for work-related
injuries or illnesses, minor illnesses, injuries, or impairments, sporadic, short-term recurrences of

50
chronic, non-life threatening conditions, short-term absences due to contagious diseases, or short-
term recurring medical or therapeutic treatments, except for conditions such as those listed above.

d. The absence due to the catastrophic or severe illness or injury of the member or a
family member must be for more than 20 workdays in the current leave calendar year. The 20-
workday absence may be accumulated on an intermittent basis if properly documented as related
to the same catastrophic or severe illness or injury. Annual, personal, sick (for member’s own
serious health condition), sick family (for the serious health condition of a family member),
holiday, compensatory, or unpaid leave may be used during the accumulation period. A separate
accumulation period must be met for each catastrophic or severe illness or injury and for each
leave calendar year in which donated leave is used. Donated leave may not be applied to the
required 20-workday accumulation period.

e. All accrued leave must be used as follows before any donation may be received:

(1) For a member’s own catastrophic or severe injury or illness, all accrued
annual, sick, personal, holiday, and compensatory leave and all anticipated annual
and sick leave for the current leave calendar year must be used.

(2) For the catastrophic or severe injury or illness of a family member, all
accrued annual, personal, holiday, and compensatory leave and all anticipated
annual leave for the current leave calendar year must be used. All five days of sick
family leave and any additional sick family leave for which the member is eligible
must be used.

f. Up to 12 weeks of donated leave per leave calendar year may be received for all
conditions of the member and family members cumulatively, but donations may not be received
in more than two consecutive leave calendar years. Donated leave is added to the recipient’s sick
leave balance on a biweekly basis. Recipients do not repay the donor for donated leave. Leave
usage is monitored closely to ensure that donated leave is used only for absences related to the
catastrophic or severe illness or injury. Upon exhaustion of the 12 week donated leave cap, a
member may request an additional donation of up to thirty (30) days which shall be allowed at the
discretion of the Commissioner and shall not be unreasonably denied. Members shall not be
required to exhaust personal days before being eligible to access the Leave Donation Program.

g. The recipient’s entitlement to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act will
be reduced by donated leave that is used. Entitlements to sick leave without pay (for a member’s
own illness) or family care leave without pay (for a family member’s illness) will also be reduced.

h. Donated leave may be used on an intermittent basis. However, each absence may
be required to be medically documented as due to the same catastrophic or severe illness or injury.

i. A member is not cligible to receive donations of leave if, during the previous six
months, the member has been placed on a written leave restriction, or has received a written
reprimand or suspension related to attendance.

51
j. Donated leave that remains unused once the member is released by the physician
for full-time work, when the family member’s condition no longer requires the member’s absence,
or at the end of the leave calendar year, must be returned to the donors in inverse order of donation.
However, if at the end of the year, the absence is expected to continue beyond the greater of 20
workdays or the amount of annual and sick leave that could be earned and used in the following
leave calendar year, donated leave may be carried into the next year.

Section 3. Donors

a. A donor may voluntarily donate annual and personal leave to a member within the
donor’s bargaining unit who meets the requirements of the Leave Donation Program. Donations
may be made to multiple members, as long as the minimum donation is made to each member.

b. Donations must be made in increments of one day (8.0 hours), but not more than
five days can be donated to any one member in the same leave calendar year. The donor’s annual
leave balance after donation cannot be less than the equivalent of five workdays of leave (40.0
hours). Anticipated personal leave may not be donated.

C. The donation is effected by the completion and submission of a Request to Donate
Leave to the Bureau of Human Resources. Leave is deducted from the donor’s annual and/or
personal leave balance at the time of donation and transferred to the recipient in order by the date
and time the Request to Donate Leave form is received.

d. Unused donations are returned to the donor if: the recipient or family member
recovers, dies, or separates before the donor’s leave is used; or if the recipient does not use the
leave by the end of the leave calendar year, and is expected to either return to work within 20
workdays or to have sufficient anticipated leave available in the new year to cover the absence. In
accordance with Section 1 above, a member whose family member dies and who does not have
accrued or anticipated sick leave available, may use donated leave as bereavement leave, subject
to the limitations in Article 14, Section 3.

Section 4. The provisions of this Article are not grievable under Article 28 of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 49

under arrest, who shall continue to be fingerprinted by enlisted personnel.

Section 4. To address future needs or issues regarding civilianization of current positions
within the bargaining unit, or functions performed by the bargaining unit, the Employer shall notify
the PSTA in writing of specific positions and/or functions that it deems appropriate or desirable

APPENDIX B

Members of the Pennsylvania State Police must be morally and ethically above reproach
at all times regardless of duty status. All members shall respect the sanctity of the law and shall
be committed to holding themselves to the highest standard of accountability. No member shall
depart from standards of professional conduct or disobey the law.

Members should be subject to disciplinary action only for “just cause.” The following
standards shall govern the elements of “just cause” for the misconduct described below and these
standards shall constitute a “clean slate” relating to the twelve terminable offenses described below
in that they shall supersede and replace all prior standards, agreements, past practices, and
arbitration awards on the same subjects.

Certain conduct immediately and absolutely threatens the integrity of the Department’s
public duty and responsibility. In the following circumstances, the proper level of discipline is
termination of employment, notwithstanding any mitigating circumstances. Such conduct
includes, but is not limited to, the following:

[1] Engaging in any action that constitutes the commission of a felony or a
misdemeanor which carries a potential sentence of more than one (1) year, or in any action that
constitutes the commission of an equivalent offense in another jurisdiction, state, or territory.
Neither a criminal conviction nor the pendency of criminal charges is necessary for disciplinary
action in such circumstances. In addition, a declination of prosecution shall not preclude
disciplinary action.

[2] Engaging in domestic violence involving physical abuse of any victim; or engaging
in activity which would cause a reasonable person to be in fear of bodily injury to the extent the
member’s conduct falls under subsection [1] above.

[3] Any use of a firearm to threaten another except as appropriate in the scope of
employment (whether or not a specific, officially assigned, duty) or in the defense of self or others.
This includes the use of a loaded or unloaded firearm to threaten another, regardless whether as a
joke or in horseplay.

[4] Engaging in sexual misconduct, as defined in AR 4-25; or engaging in sexual
harassment as defined in AR 4-26 which is of a serious nature, including use of position to obtain
or attempt to obtain sexual favors; or engaging in conduct which constitutes sexual harassment, as
defined in AR 4-26, subsequent to disciplinary action for prior serious sexual harassment.

[5] The commission of a serious act of deception during a criminal, civil or
administrative investigation or proceeding, when under a specific, official obligation to be truthful,
involving intentional (1) lying; (2) fabrication; (3) misleading acts or words; (4) civil or criminal
fraud; or (5) perjury.

57
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no member may be subject to
disciplinary charges for violating this subsection in regard to a statement or statements the member
made ina Departmental disciplinary investigation involving another member before the allegations
involving the underlying investigation of that other member have been either dismissed by the
Department or sustained or dismissed by an arbitrator as provided herein.

[6] Any activity that constitutes an intentional violation of Chapter 39 of the Crimes
Code (relating to Theft and Related Offenses).

[7] Any use of any illegal substances, prohibited under 35 P.S. § 780-101 et seq.,
(Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act), or any substance use that constitutes the
commission of an offense under Federal law or in any other jurisdiction, state, or territory, either
on or off duty; or any use of controlled substances obtained by illegal means, either on or off duty.

[8] Positive drug test result under FR 3-5.

[9] “Driving under the influence” pleas, convictions or ARD under one of the following
circumstances:

(a) Second or subsequent DUI offense while employed by the Commonwealth
(regardless of whether on or off duty); or

(b) Involving a hit and run of a vehicle or property; or
(c) While operating a state-owned vehicle.

[10] Any restriction mandated by statue or court order for 180 days or more under one
of the following circumstances:

(a) Loss of Pennsylvania operating privileges, except for recall or suspension
of operating privileges of any person whose incompetency has been
established under Title 75 Pa. C.S. § 1519 (Motor Vehicle Code).

(b) Loss of firearm privileges.

[11] Fighting or the use of other physical violence on the job, other than as reasonably
necessary in the strict performance of a member’s duties as a law enforcement officer.

[12] Any period of incarceration for a misdemeanor conviction that results in the
member being disqualified from accessing information from the CLEAN system in accordance
with the FBI Criminal Justice Information Security (CJIS) Policy.

This list is not all-inclusive and termination of employment may be the proper level of
discipline in other situations as well.

A criminal standard of proof shall not be applied to the review of any termination decision.

58
The above provisions are effective for discipline arising out of any conduct occurring, in
full or in part, on or after January 1, 2005. These provisions supersede any prior disciplinary
penalties imposed for the twelve (12) offenses specifically set forth herein, by either the
Department, Commonwealth, or any arbitrator, and no such prior penalties may be used as
precedent in cases involving the above twelve (12) offenses.
