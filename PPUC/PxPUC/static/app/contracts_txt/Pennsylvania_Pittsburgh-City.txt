RECOGNITION

SECTION 1 - RECOGNITION

A. The City recognizes the Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Pitt Lodge No. 1 (“FOP”) as the sole
and exclusive collective bargaining representative concerning the terms and conditions of
employment, including compensation, hours, working conditions, retirement, pensions and

other benefits for all employees as provided in Act 111 of 1968.

B. The FOP recognizes the Mayor as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for the City
of Pittsburgh. The FOP, its agents and representatives, agrees to bargain collectively pursuant

to Act 111 of 1968 with only the Mayor or his designated representative.

C. Newly hired police officers shall be required to serve a probationary period of twelve (12)
months, the term of which shall commence upon successful completion of the Pennsylvania
Municipal Police Officers Education and Training Commission (MPOETC) certification and
examination. All terms and conditions of employment under this Collective Bargaining
Agreement apply to the officer during the probationary period except for the just cause

requirements applicable to disciplinary action, including termination.

D. The just cause provisions shall apply to the officer once the probationary period ends. The
officer shall be entitled to voluntarily join the Fraternal Order of Police Fort Pitt Lodge #1
(FOP) after successfully completing the MPOETC examination and being sworn in by the City
of Pittsburgh as a police officer for the City of Pittsburgh. Each employee shall then be
accorded the right to appeal, as not being for proper cause, any employment termination action
to the Civil Service Commission; provided such appeal is filed within ten (10) work days of

the City’s notice of that termination, or pursuant to Section 5 of the Working Agreement.

E. Communications in writing between the parties, for purposes of this Working Agreement shall

include memoranda, letters, signed or unsigned email communications, but not text messages.
F. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES

1. The City, its representatives at all levels, is bound to observe the provisions of this Agreement.
The FOP, its officers, Board members, and representatives at all levels, is bound to observe the

provisions of this Agreement.

2. In addition to the responsibilities that may be provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the

following shall be observed:

a. There shall be no interference with the right of any employee to become or to continue

as a member of the FOP.

b. There shall be no discrimination, restraint, or coercion against any employee because of

membership of the FOP.
c. There shall be no FOP activity on City time except as provided in Section 5-E-2.

d. There shall be no intimidation or coercion of employees into joining the FOP or

continuing membership therein.

3. The provisions of this Agreement shall be applied to all employees without regard to race,
color, religious creed, national origin or sex. The representatives of the City and the FOP, shall

comply with this provision in all steps of the grievance procedure and in all dealings between the

parties.
DUES CHECK OFF

SECTION 2 —- DUES CHECK OFF

A. Is The City will check off uniform and regular monthly dues as designated by the FOP
in writing to the City on the basis of individually signed voluntary check-off
authorization cards. This shall include deductions from compensation paid pursuant
to the Heart and Lung Act, 53 P.S. 637 if the City has received a voluntary check-
off authorization card signed by the employee specifically permitting the City to
deduct dues from compensation paid pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act. A copy
of such authorization card for the check-off of FOP dues shall be furnished to the
City. These authorizations shall not be sent more frequently than once each month.
Deductions on the basis of authorization cards submitted to the City shall
commence for the month in which the City receives such card or in which such card
becomes effective, whichever is later. In case of earnings insufficient to cover
deductions, a deduction shall be made from the next pay in which there is sufficient
eamings or a double deduction may be made from the pay of the following month,

provided, however that any accumulation of dues shall be limited to two (2) months.

2. If the FOP shall increase the amount of its monthly and/or annual dues subsequent
to the execution of then current dues check-off authorization cards by members of
the bargaining unit, the then current dues check-off authorization cards shall be
considered sufficient authorization to the City to increase the amount of FOP dues

deducted by it from the earnings of the respective members of the bargaining unit.

3, Written notification from an appropriate officer of the FOP to the City that the FOP
has increased its periodic dues shall be considered by the City as constituting
adequate notice and authority for it to increase the amount of any dues deduction

that it deducts from the earnings of members of the bargaining unit.
4. The City shall, at the direction of the FOP, make extra dues deductions from an
employee who is in delinquent status. If an employee is absent from work for
reasons other than those already provided for in this Agreement, the FOP may,
when said employee returns to work, submit written notification to the City
statingthe amount of dues delinquency and the number of months an extra dues

deduction shall be taken from an employee’s pay.

The City shall remit to the FOP all monies deducted and a list of all employees for whom
a deduction has been made on or before the 15" day of the month after such deductions are

made.

The FOP shall indemnify and save the City harmless against any and all claims, demands,
suits, or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reason of any action or inaction
taken by the City for the purpose of complying with any of the provisions of this Section,

or in reliance on any list, notice, or assignment furnished under any such provisions.
SENIORITY

SECTION 3 —- SENIORITY

A seniority system based upon continuous service and applicable ability considerations
shall be followed for employment security and work assignment determinations, to include annual
“Job Pick” selections and awards of and to police service employees, during the term of this
Agreement. In connection therewith, the following definitions and rules are to be applied by the

City.

A. Continuous Service — The “continuous service” status of each bargaining unit employee
shall mean all “unbroken” service, from the date of his or her initial employment as a Police
Officer in the Police Bureau. A break in such service will result, however, upon the

occurrence of any of the following:

1. voluntary quit;
2. termination for cause; or
3, absence in excess of five (5) days without any justifiable reason and/or without any

“report off’ from work within that period of absence.

4, Any continuous absence due to a non-work related disability for a total of twelve
(12) continuous months or for a total of twelve (12) cumulative months in a twenty-
four (24) month period shall result in a break in continuous service and termination
of employment. The period of absence runs prospectively from April 1, 2001. Any
employee who is terminated under this provision for a non-work related disability
will be able, within five (5) years following termination, to present evidence to the
City physician establishing that the non-work related disability has been overcome,
and that the former officer is able to return to full duty. In such case, the officer

will be reinstated, and his continuous service shall be bridged for all purposes.
Job or “Rank” Seniority — Each employee will be accorded job or “rank” seniority, from
the date of his or her initial promotion to any rank, with his or her “continuous service”
status therefore running from that date. Seniority for any lower ranks held by an employee
will continue while he or she holds any higher rank, of any Police Officer job. In the event
an employee is reinstated after having terminated employment, he or she shall be accorded

full credit for all time served as a Police Officer in the Police Bureau.

Bureau-Wide Seniority - Each employee will be accorded a “bureau-wide” continuous
service or “seniority” status from the date of his or her initial employment on any job in
the Police Bureau of the City. This seniority shall be applied in cases of any decrease in

force and/or recall action affecting employees in his/her job or rank, by the City.

Annual Bidding (Job Pick) Procedures - By September 15 of each calendar year, the Chief
of Police shall forward to the FOP his projected manning level notice for the Bureau of
Police for the following year. The FOP shall have the right to grieve in an expedited
manner any issues concerning the proposed picks. The parties shall select a neutral
arbitrator prior to September 15 to decide any expedited grievances so as not to delay the

October 1 posting date.

1. Uniform Division Employees

a. By October 1, and continuing until October 31, of each calendar year, the
Chief of Police shall cause a posting of Projected Manning Level notices
indicating regular assignments and shifts to be filled by Uniformed Officers
(including desk officers), and listing the names, ranks and service dates of
such officers assigned, at and for all Police Stations maintained by the City.
These notices shall include a “sign up” page or “Pick Sheet” for each
position (by shift) to be posted and filled, at and for each such Police

Station.
b. The Chief of Police shall have the discretion to create and post units
within which qualified Uniformed Police Officers may bid, and place
qualified Uniformed Police Officers within them. These positions are
considered exempt. An exempt position is one which requires, or will
require after appointment, training or ability that is not required for basic
patrol assignments. The City will send to the FOP a written statement as to
the qualifications it considers in placing employees in the units. The FOP
shall have the right to a meet and discuss within 10 days of the receipt of
the positing if it perceives the posting as an attempt to circumvent seniority
or other “contractual” rights of Uniformed Police Officers. This shall not

prohibit an Officer from filing a grievance to challenge their non-selection.

c. In the event that the City-wide bidding process is not utilized for all
positions in Operations in any given bidding cycle, then the twenty five
percent (25%) most senior police officers (excluding sergeants and
lieutenants) assigned to work in the uniform division each year shall be
permitted to elect the zone in which they will work that year, in order of

seniority.

d. During the above said “posting” period, all Uniform Police Officers at
each Station shall be given an opportunity to sign the Pick Sheet notice
reflecting the regular “position” (and shift) of his or her choice. Any
employee who fails to sign up for any regular position and shift assignment
posted, or whose choice of position and shift is awarded to a senior
employee, shall be assigned to one, without regard to his or her seniority

status, by the Commander at the Station.

e. All regular position and shift assignment selections under Paragraph B

hereof shall be made and awarded on a “seniority” basis, from among all
qualified Uniform Division employees at each Police Station. Any
employee who fails to obtain his indicated choice of such assignments will
be given aright to make anew choice within the posting period of Paragraph

(d) above, and will be considered therefore, on the same basis.

All employees assigned to Zones shall be permitted to bid on car, wagon,
utility or COP assignments on the basis of seniority. Regular COP
assignments shall be posted and shall indicate the two (2) consecutive pass

days and the shift.

By November 15 of each calendar year, the Chief will post Officer
Assignment notices, indicating all regular positions assigned, by name, rank
and applicable service date of each employee so assigned, at and for each
Police Station, for the next following calendar year. A copy of this notice

will be provided to the Local FOP President.

As provided in Paragraph (a)-(b) above, all Station assignments of Uniform

Division (and other) employees will be made by the Chief of Police.

If, after the assignments within a Police Station for a calendar year take
effect, an opening in an assignment occurs due to a resignation, retirement,
including disability retirement, death, or promotion which the City

determines to fill, then the vacancy shall be posted for bid within the Police
Station or unit before transferring a Uniformed Police Officer from another
Police Station or unit. The City may fill such openings at any time by
posting for bid, but if the City gives the assignment to Uniformed Police
Officers for thirty (30) calendar days then it will be deemed to have
determined to post the opening for bid. The assignment and shift shall be
posted for bid for ten (10) calendar days but otherwise the procedure for
bidding shall be the same as under subparagraphs d and e above. Only the
initial opening caused by one of the events described above shall be filled
by this procedure. Nothing in this subsection shall force the City to make

promotions.

If, on a particular shift, the City must fill a vehicle assignment open on that
shift, then the City shall fill it first from among Uniformed Police Officers
who have successfully bid upon vehicle assignments but who have no
vehicle available on that shift. If there are more open vehicle assignments
on that shift than there are available Uniformed Police Officers who have
successfully bid upon vehicle assignments, then the open vehicle
assignments will be given to Uniformed Police Officers who successfully
bid upon utility assignments, first by request, then by inverse order of
seniority. The City may bypass any Uniformed Police Officer for an open
vehicle assignment on a particular shift if the City, in good faith, believes
that because of compatibility, the Uniformed Police Officer will not be
effective in that assignment on that shift.

Picks shall be made in the following order

Lieutenants shall pick first.

Sergeants shall pick second.

Detectives shall pick third.

Master Police Officers shall pick fourth.
4" Year Patrol Officers shall pick fifth.
De

3 Year Patrol Officers shall pick sixth.
2™ Year Patrol Officers shall pick seventh.
1* Year Patrol Officers shall pick eighth.

For seniority purposes in the Detective Bureau only, all persons assigned to
the Detective Bureau prior to February 17, 1998 shall have their seniority
based upon total service as a Police Officer. Any person permanently
appointed to the Detective Bureau after February 17, 1998 shall have their

seniority based upon time in grade as a detective.

The City may, in its sole discretion, utilize an annual city-wide picking of
shifts in the uniform division in order of seniority as is currently provided
to the top 25% most senior officers and excluding lieutenants. Sergeants (in
the uniform division) will be permitted to exercise their seniority to pick
their duty location. The City will be permitted to move lieutenants for the
"good of the bureau" as defined by the parties' arbitral history and/or for the
purpose of enhancing the Bureau by utilizing/matching the individual skill
set/abilities of a lieutenant with the needs of a particular work unit provided
such assignment was not arbitrary or capricious. This change shall be done
on a trial basis to provide the City with the opportunity to assess the

efficiency and effectiveness of the change to the staffing process.

This trial period is for the October 2020 bidding process (establishing
January 2021 assignments) and may be reopened at any time by the City or
the FOP for any reason by notice to the three members of the Board of

Arbitration during April 2021 to include any aspect of the bidding process.

This issue may be reopened by written notice by either Party to the Board

Members during the month of April, 2021.

Other Employees

10
A procedure similar to that described in Paragraph (a) -- (b) above will be followed
for regular position and shift assignments to employees “outside” of the Uniform
Division. A separate such procedure may be established and applied to any

reasonable “groupings” of such employees, as determined by the Chief of Police.

3. Removal from Exempt Positions

a. In the event that an exempt position is eliminated, reduced, or reorganized,

removal will occur in order of inverse City-wide seniority.

b. Removal from a specialized position for reasons other than as stated in subsection
(a) above shall be for reasonable grounds. Notice of such removal shall be
accompanied by a written explanation setting forth the reasons. If a member wishes
to appeal such decision to remove, they may use the grievance procedures set forth

in Section 5 of this agreement.

c. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the City’s right to transfer

employees in accordance with Section 3(E).

Transfers and Reassignments

1. Permanent

Permanent transfers of employees from their regular position or shift assignments,
at any Station, will be made only with the consent of each affected employee, so
long as the regular position and shift assignment selected by him continues to be

manned at his Station, during that calendar year, by the City.

gt Temporary

11
Station, position and/or shift transfers or reassignments, including in the
Investigative Branch, of any employee(s) for a period not to exceed ninety (90) in
any calendar year — shall be deemed “temporary.” Normally such transfers shall
first be done through seeking volunteers and if an insufficient number of volunteers
are available, then the transfers shall normally be made in inverse order of seniority.
Such “temporary” transfers or reassignments are to be based upon Police service
requirements, as determined by the Chief of Police. The Chief shall have an
unfettered right to determine such requirements, and to make such temporary
transfers or reassignments, during the period of this Agreement. However, no
transfer under this paragraph may be made for disciplinary reasons. In the event of
an emergency, the transfers may be made without first seeking volunteers or
without reverting to the use of inverse order of seniority. If special skills or abilities
are needed or if the transfer would result in overtime the transfer may be made

without first seeking volunteers.

Personal Transfers

Any employee may request a transfer from one shift to another or one station to
another within the Operations Division. All such requests shall be in writing with
a copy to the FOP. Requests for transfer may be granted only for compelling
personal reasons or inability to adequately perform assigned duties. Requests for
transfer shall be granted provided there is a vacant position as determined by the
City, available or another employee will consent to trade shift or station assignment
with the employee requesting the transfer and the employee is capable of
performing the assigned duties of the new shift or station. In the event that more
requests are received than may be accommodated, preference in granting such
transfers shall be based on length of continuous service. Final discretion as to

whether or not a transfer is to be granted shall rest with the Chief.

12
4. Bureau Transfers

Employees may be transferred by the Chief, or their Commander, either temporarily
or permanently, to another shift or station for the good of the Bureau. The City
may transfer officers, for the good of the bureau, where events or circumstances,
jeopardize the ability of the officers to safely perform the duties of their position,
including pending litigation or disciplinary action. Bureau transfers, for the purpose
of affording necessary police service, shall as far as practicable be in the reverse
order of length of continuous service. Nothing in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this
subsection prohibits the City from transferring employees from their picked job
assignments at one Police Station or unit to another police station or unit in

accordance with this paragraph.

5. Employees are to have two (2) weeks notice of permanent, involuntary transfers
from any Police Station to another, except in the case of emergencies or as the needs

of public safety require.

Seniority Roster Postings — Two (2) separate Seniority Rosters will be posted at each Police
Station, one (1) listing the names, ranks, service dates, station and shift assignments of all
bargaining unit employees and the other listing the names, ranks, service dates and shift
assignments of employees at that particular Police Station. The City shall supply to the
Fraternal Order of Police, a seniority list in inverse order of seniority with dates of
promotion to last rank and category within the Pittsburgh Police. Said seniority list shall

be provided to the Fraternal Order of Police no later than June 1* of each calendar year.

13
MANAGEMENT

SECTION 4-—- MANAGEMENT

A. The City and the Director of the Department of Public Safety, through the Chief of Police
shall have the exclusive right to manage, administer, and supervise the employees
including the right to schedule and assign work, transfer, and the sole and exclusive right
to determine the size and organization of the Police Bureau including the discretion to
determine vacancies and to fill vacancies in accordance with the needs of the Bureau and
the public safety as determined by the Chief of Police, Director of the Department of Public
Safety, and the Mayor.

B. The parties recognize that the procedure for appointments, promotions, and reduction of
force, suspensions and discharges is as provided by the Police Civil Service Act for Cities

discharge, suspension, reduction in rank or reduction in pay of employees in the
competitive class then the collective bargaining agreement will be amended to reflect said

changes.

ce. Except in an emergency situation, the Chief of Police, Deputy Chief, Assistant Chiefs and
Commanders will notify and provide a copy to the FOP, at least 15 days prior to the
implementation of any change in the Rules and Regulations of the Bureau, and any new
General Order. This notice is to provide the FOP with a chance to review and, if desired,

to discuss the order or regulation in question with Police Administration.

14
FOP Bulletin Boards shall be provided at all stations and divisions subject to normal City

tules and regulations against inappropriate usage.

The FOP shall be notified in writing by the City of any disciplinary action or actions taken
by it against any member of the bargaining unit within seven (7) calendar days of such

action.

The Mayor of the City shall provide the President of the FOP with a copy of his proposed
budget for the next fiscal year at approximately the same time that the Mayor submits such

proposed budget to City Council.

The FOP shall be notified in writing by the City of all new hires, promotions or
terminations which occur within the bargaining unit, as well as any changes which
materially affect the job status of members of the bargaining unit within fifteen (15)

calendar days subsequent to such event.

The City may, at its sole discretion, subcontract any work presently performed by the
bargaining unit. The City will engage in meet and discuss with the FOP prior to taking any

such action.

15

9. Disciplinary termination grievances shall take precedence over contract grievances.
PROCEDURE
1, Step One

a. Any employee who believes that he (or she) has a grievance and is unable

to the Step Two level by the FOP filing an appeal in writing within fourteen
(14) days of the Chief’s Step One answer.

f. Information and documents shall be exchanged in good faith during the
grievance process by the City and the FOP with the arbitrator retaining the
sole discretion on admission of the documents for evidentiary purposes at

after the date of such meeting, unless a different date for such disposition is
agreed upon by the parties. If the City is unable or unwilling to meet within
fourteen (14) days then the FOP may proceed to Step III without prejudice
to the positions of either party.

18
b. If the Step Two meeting is held, and if the Mayor’s answer in Step Two is
not appealed in writing within fourteen (14) days after the written answer
by the Mayor (or designee) the particular grievance shall be considered
settled on the basis of such decision, and shall not be eligible for further
appeal. If the Mayor (or designee) does not answer within fourteen (14)
calendar days, the grievance shall be considered granted, without necessity
for further appeal. The resolution at this step shall be final and binding
should a Party fail to meet the time period specified, with the grievance
either being denied with prejudice or granted, with the remedy being
implemented which is consistent with the relief requested by the FOP in the

grievance and the contractual provisions at issue.

3. Step Three

a. Any grievance which has been processed in accordance with the provisions
of this Section, but which has not been satisfactorily resolved may, upon
proper appeal, be submitted to arbitration before an impartial Arbitrator to

be selected from the list of impartial arbitrators established by the parties as

set forth below.

i. The City and the FOP shall each submit the names of twelve (12)
arbitrators who are members of the National Academy of
Arbitrators.

ii. The first nine (9) names that appear on both lists shall comprise a

permanent panel of arbitrators.

11. If less than nine (9) names appear on both lists, all names that appear
on both lists shall be on the permanent panel and the remaining

names shall be combined into one list.

19
lv. From the combined list of names, each party will alternately strike
one name (the City shall strike first) until a total of nine (9)

arbitrators have been selected overall.

Vv. The nine (9) selected arbitrators, in alphabetical order, shall

comprise the panel of Arbitrators for the term of this Agreement.

b. The Arbitrator shall be requested to submit his decision, in writing, within
thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearing or hearings (and/or receipt of
any transcript and/or briefs thereof) and the decision of the Arbitrator, so rendered
shall be final and binding upon the employee involved and upon the Parties to this
Agreement. Where a dispute relates to the scale of wages or benefits in any way,
any decision rendered shall not be made retroactive for more than thirty (30) days
beyond the date on which the dispute first was presented, in writing, as a grievance.
The fees and expenses of arbitration shall be borne in equal shares by the City and
the FOP. The Arbitrator shall not have the right to add to, subtract from, modify,

or disregard any of the terms or provisions of the Agreement.

MULTIPLE GRIEVANCES AND FOP GRIEVANCES

In order to avoid the necessity of filing numerous grievances on the same subject or event,
or concerning the same alleged contract violation occurring on different occasions, a single
grievance may be processed and the facts of alleged additional violations including the
dates thereof may be presented in writing directly in Step 2. Such additional claims shall
be filed promptly and each additional claimant shall be clearly identified. When the
original grievance is resolved in the grievance or arbitration procedure, the parties
resolving such grievance shall review each pending claim in the light of the decision in an
effort to dispose of them. If any such claim is not settled, it shall thereafter be considered
as a separate grievance and processed in accordance with the applicable procedure and the

applicable time limitations.

20
E.

GRIEVANCE REPRESENTATIVES

1.

The FOP shall designate to the City in writing the names of the FOP officers and
shall certify in writing the names of eighteen (18) authorized grievance
representatives. Any changes in FOP representation shall be recognized by the City

only after the changes are certified to the City in writing by the FOP.

Authorized grievance representatives will be allowed time off without pay to attend
meetings and hearings and to visit other work sites for the purpose of transacting
grievance business after notice to the supervisor. Such permission for time off shall
not be requested when the FOP activity could reasonably be performed during non-
working hours, and, such permission shall not be unreasonably withheld by the

supervisors involved.

Bargaining unit members appointed to the Tripartite Panel shall be considered to
be on-duty during meetings of the tripartite panel. Bargaining unit members shall

account for their time on a Departmental time sheet.

21
SALARIES

SECTION 6 —- SALARIES

A.

In each calendar year of this Agreement, the basic hourly and annual salary rates for

bargaining unit job classifications shall be established as follows:

Effective January 1, 1998 there shall be one grade of detective which shall be paid at the
rate of four and one half (4.5%) percent above the fourth year police officer rate. All
existing first grade detectives shall maintain arate of one and one half(1.5%) percent above

the detective rate.

In determining the hourly rate to be applied for overtime and any other purpose under this
Collective Bargaining Agreement, the hourly rate shall be determined by dividing the

annual base rate by 2,080.

If an employee is transferred into the Detective Bureau and assigned to perform the duties
of the detective job description, the employee shall be paid at the rate for a Detective
effective after having been assigned to the Detective Bureau to perform the duties of the
detective job description for ninety (90) days in any one hundred twenty (120) day period.
A police officer so assigned shall be paid the rate of a Detective based on his or her
assignment to work in the Detective Bureau as a detective for ninety (90) days in any one
hundred twenty (120) day period whether or not the police officer is appointed as a graded
detective pursuant to the Civil Service procedures applicable to the City of Pittsburgh
Police Department. If a person is assigned to an Investigative position and is not made a
graded detective, he/she shall have the right to be addressed as “detective” for the duration
of their assignment. An officer assigned to a detective position shall be required to
complete only one ninety (90) day probationary period in order to be eligible to receive

detective pay. If an officer is transferred from a detective position, after completion of the

22
probationary period, any subsequent reassignment to a detective position shall result in the

officer being immediately eligible for detective pay.

If an employee is assigned to a higher graded position by a Lieutenant, Acting Lieutenant,
or higher ranking officer, the employee shall be compensated for all hours so worked at the
standard hourly wage rate of the position to which assigned. Assignment of an employee
to the grade of Acting Lieutenant must be approved by a Commander, Assistant Chief or

the Chief.

Effective January 1 2018, Lieutenant rank differential shall be 14% above Sergeant pay
rate and Sergeant rank differential shall be 14% above Master Patrol Officer pay rate. All

other existing rank and grade pay differentials shall remain as is.

Thirty years through thirty-nine years 10,000
Forty years or more 15,000

The annual dollar amount of longevity received by any officer under the above plan shall
not be less than the dollar amount of longevity received by that officer in 2009. An officer
will continue to receive the same, frozen amount of longevity pay under the 2009 plan until
such time as his annual payment under the above plan exceeds the former plan. Thereafter,

the officer will receive annual payments pursuant to the above plan.

If City Council has approved supplemental pay for officers involuntarily called to military
duty, said officers will receive longevity pay without satisfying the One Day Work Rule.

This provision will be effective retroactive to January 1, 2002.

The longevity payment shall be paid in the first pay period following the employee’s
anniversary date, provided, however, that any employee who has achieved twenty (20)

years of service shall be paid in February.

Except as provided in paragraph B and paragraph C, no officer shall be entitled to receive

longevity pay unless the officer works a minimum of one (1) day in that calendar year.

26
HOURS OF WORK

SECTION 8 — HOURS OF WORK

A.

This Section defines the normal hours of work, but shall not be construed, either, as a
guarantee of hours of work and pay or as a basis for calculating overtime hours of work

and pay, except as provided for, otherwise, in this Agreement.

The normal workday shall be eight (8) consecutive hours of work. An employee
shall be entitled to a meal period of one-half (1/2) hour while on duty during the
eight (8) hour work period. It is understood that the employee is on duty and on

call at any time during the meal period.

The normal workweek shall be five (5) workdays beginning on the first day of any
seven (7) consecutive day period which may begin on any day of the calendar week.
Workdays shall be consecutive except for days off. The normal two (2) days off

shall be consecutive days off.

The normal workweek shall apply except in emergency cases for the suppression
of riots or tumults or the preservation of the public peace in times of riot,

conflagration, or public celebrations.

Time spent by employees in attendance in Court and Magistrate sessions, including lunch
breaks, as required by subpoena by the District Attorney’s Office or as required by the
Chief of Police, is time worked and shall be compensated as such. Such time worked shall
be compensated at the regular rate or at the overtime rate, depending upon whether it
qualified as straight-time or overtime, provided, however, that employees required to
attend pretrial or Federal, State, County, or City Court and Magistrate sessions shall be
guaranteed at least three (3) hours pay at the applicable rate. This paragraph shall also

apply to Law Department and Human Relations Hearings, Merit Board, OMI interviews,

27
and in Trial Boards and Boards of inquiry for sitting members or witnesses for the

prosecution.

An officer who appears in court as a defendant in a civil or criminal case arising out of the
performance of police duties may elect to havehis shift changed to coincide with scheduled
court appearances. An officer electing such change would waive any claim to overtime
within a twenty-four (24) hour period in relation to his regularly scheduled shift. Subject
to the approval of the County and the courts, an officer required to attend City Court must
select either morning or afternoon schedule for court hearings. No election will be
honored, however, if it would create a claim for overtime compensation that would not

otherwise exist.

An employee whose court appearance continues into the employee’s shift shall be entitled
to pay for time worked only. The three hour court appearance guarantee shall be

inapplicable.

An employee whose court appearance starts one and one-half hours or less prior to the
employee’s shift may be required to report for duty immediately after the court appearance

and the three hour court appearance guarantee shall be inapplicable.

If an employee’s court appearance starts more than one and one-half hours prior to the
employee’s shift and ends prior to the employee’s shift, the three hour court appearance
guarantee shall be applicable whether or not the employee is asked to report to work

immediately after the court appearance.

If a court appearance occurs more than one and one-half (1 4) hours after the end of an
employee’s shift, the employee shall be entitled to the three (3) hour court appearance

guarantee whether or not the employee is held over until the appearance begins.

28
If a court appearance occurs one and one-half (1 '4) hours or less after the end of an
employee shift, the employee may be held over for the court appearance. In this event, the
employee shall be paid for hours worked only and the three (3) hour court appearance

guarantee shall be inapplicable.

An employee required to make two court appearances in a day may be held over on duty
from the first to the second court appearance. In this event the three hour court appearance

guarantee is applicable only to the first court appearance.

Overtime hours accrued as a result of court time can, at the discretion of the officer, be paid
as overtime or be banked as compensatory time subject to the rules and procedure set forth

in Section 26.

Call Outs - Except for Court or Magistrate sessions covered by Paragraph B above, an
employee called out to work for any period other than the period of his or her previously
scheduled hours of work shall be guaranteed at least four (4) hours of work or pay and shall
be compensated at applicable overtime pay rates for such ‘call out’ time. Previously
scheduled hours of work of any affected employee shall not be rearranged or reduced

because of call out work under these provisions.

Except in “emergency” situations, or where requested and agreed to by the affected
employees, any change in previously scheduled hours of work shall be made and posted
no later than Thursday of the week preceding the calendar week in which the change is to
take effect, or by the end of the last shift worked by the affected employee during that

preceding week, whichever occurs first.

When any change is made in the schedule of, any employee in any manner contrary to the
provisions of Paragraph E above, he/she shall be deemed to have reported for work on his
regular shift and shall be paid on that basis, with all other hours worked on that day

compensated for, at the appropriate “overtime” pay rate.

29
The Chief (or designee) may waive the “40 hour work rule” by permitting officers to accrue
overtime after 8 hours of work during the work week encompassing a Special Event. For
purposes of this Section a “Special Event” shall be defined to include: First Night, St.
Patrick’s Day (and related parades), Light Up Night, Independence Day, Regatta, Great
Race, Marathon, Pride Fest, and Sports Championships. The Chief (or designee) may also

elect to waive the “40 hour work rule” up to six additional times per calendar year.

This issue may be reopened by written notice by either Party to the Board of Arbitration

during the month of April 2021.

Shift differential - For hours worked on the afternoon shift there shall be paid a premium
rate of 2.00% of the hourly rate; and for hours worked on the night shift there shall be paid
a premium rate of 3.00% of the hourly rate; and for hours worked between 4:00 P.M. and

11:00 P.M. there shall be paid a premium rate of 4.00% of the hourly rate.

1. For purposes of applying the aforesaid shift differentials, all hours worked by an
employee during the workday shall be considered as worked on the shift on which he or

she is regularly scheduled to start work, except,

a) An employee regularly scheduled for the day or afternoon shift who
completes his or her regular eight-hour turn and continues to work into
the following shift shall be paid the applicable shift differential for all

hours worked on the following shift.
b) An employee who completes his or her regular eight hour turn and after
going off duty is called out for another shift within the same workday shall

be paid the applicable shift differential if any, for the hours works on the
other shift.

2. Shifts shall be identified in accordance with the following:

30
b)

Day Shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence between 6:00

a.m. and 8:00 a.m. inclusive.

Afternoon Shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence

between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. inclusive.

Night Shift includes all turns regularly scheduled to commence between
10:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. inclusive.

Shift differential shall be included in the calculation of overtime compensation,

except when such overtime results from an appearance in court but shall not be part

of the base wage for any other purpose.

Any hours worked by an employee on a regularly scheduled shift which

commences at a time not specified in Paragraph 2 above shall be paid as follows:

a)

b)

d)

For hours worked which would fall in the prevailing day turn of the Bureau

no shift differential shall be paid.

For hours worked which would fall in the prevailing afternoon turn of the

Bureau the afternoon shift differential shall be paid.

For hours worked which would fall in the prevailing night turn of the Bureau

the night shift differential shall be paid.

For all hours worked by an employee during any shift which begins after
4:00 p.m. and before 11:00 p.m., the employee shall be paid a shift
differential of 4.00% of the hourly rate.

31
EXCHANGE OF PASS DAYS
1. Employees assigned to the same station, division and of equal rank may exchange
complete pass days and tours of duty, subject to the approval of the Assistant Chief

and/or his Designated Representative

2. No overtime liability due to such exchanges shall accrue to the City nor shall the
City assume responsibility for enforcement or repayment of time between the

officers involved.

3), In no event are exchanges of duty tours to be granted in order for any employee to
make profit or for the purpose of assuming outside employment of any length or

duration.

Nothing in the Award of December 30, 2004 shall be construed to change the present

practice regarding minimum pay for court appearances.

32
OVERTIME

SECTION 9 - OVERTIME

A.

DEFINITIONS

1. The workweek shall consist of seven (7) consecutive days beginning 12:01 a.m. on
Monday.

2. The workday is the twenty-four (24) hour period beginning with the time the

employee begins work.

3, The regular rate of pay as used in this Agreement shall mean the standard hourly
wage rate which the employee would have received for the work assigned had it

been performed during the 40 hour work week.

4. For purposes of overtime payments, based on Wheeler v. Hampton, 399 F.3
238 (C.A.3 (Pa.) 2005), the annual base pay will include longevity pay, and
shift differential at the median rate, proposed by the City of three (3%)

percent.

Overtime rates of one and one-half (1'/2) times the regular rate will be paid for:

1. During any workweek wherein an officer actually works more than forty hours, the
hours in excess of forty hours will be paid at a premium rate of one and one half times the
officer’s regular rate. Overtime hours accrued as a result of this provision can, at the
discretion of the officer, be paid as overtime or be banked as a compensatory time subject

to the rules and procedure set forth in Section 26.

The City may not cancel a police officer’s pass day on a non-emergency basis
without first offering to fill the staffing need with another officer on a voluntary
basis. The City may offer the opportunity to other officers in the zone or officers

in other zones (including the reassignment of officers from plain clothes to uniform

33
patrol) on a voluntary basis. An emergency shall be defined by Section 8 (A) (3).
If officers are forced to work on pass days, then the order of selection shall be by
inverse seniority. If officers are forced to work on pass days, then the order of

selection shall be by inverse seniority.

Payment of overtime rates shall not be duplicated for the same hours worked. Hours
compensated for at overtime rates shall not be counted further for any purpose in
determining overtime liability under the same or any other provisions of this

Agreement.
Improper Absenteeism Exclusion

Any employee who absents himself (herself) from work without permission or
justification, or whose pattern of absences otherwise demonstrates an abuse (it is to be
noted that patterns of attendance abuse do properly subject an employee to discipline), and
who does not challenge the determination that such absence(s) were made without
permission or justification, under this Agreement, may be required to make up the time not
worked, in four (4) hour periods, at any time and in any assignment directed therefore, by

the Chief of Police.

All “make up” work under this provision will be compensable on a “regular time” pay
basis; provided that any affected employee be accorded an option to elect and accept a
suspension penalty for periods not to exceed three (3) days and a fine in an amount not
to exceed three (3) days’ pay, in addition—in lieu of such make-up work—for each
improper absence. Any unchallenged improper failure by the employee to “make up”
any time lost, as directed by the Chief, shall be deemed an election and acceptance of

a suspension penalty and fine under this Section.
Any election and acceptance of such suspension penalty and fine under this provision

shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any right to protest that suspension penalty and

fine, under any City or State Law or Agreement provision in effect at the time.

34
All shift changes shall occur on the first of each month. The first eight (8) hours worked

on the first day of a new schedule shall be compensated at straight time.

The existing DCOP-17-060 Memorandum, dated March 25, 2017, shall be continued
with amendment to include NROs. This issue may be reopened by written notice by

either Party to the Board Members during the month of April, 2021.

OVERTIME PAY AND ACTING PAY OPPORTUNITIES

1. Whenever the need arises to hire on over time a lieutenant or sergeant (and on-duty
manpower is not available), hire the person of the rank to be filled if the cost is the
same as hiring a lower rank to act in a higher capacity. (Thus, the practice will
continue of making a lower rank act in a higher capacity, as long as it is not on

overtime and the cost is only acting pay.)

wv As long as the lieutenant or sergeant who is offered the overtime is not on pass, this
will prevail. A lieutenant or sergeant who is on pass is free to volunteer to work at
time and a half, provided he/she agrees not to demand the overtime rate applicable
for pass day work. This in no way creates a mandatory manning level, and the

Bureau will continue to have a lower rank act if on-duty manpower is available.

3. Offers will be made consistent with the terms of DCOP-17-060.

4. When there is an opportunity to offer an acting duty assignment to a lower ranking
officer, officers who are currently on the active promotion eligible list for the rank
to be filled will be offered the opportunity. Where there is no current or valid
promotional list, the City may utilize any officer that it deems qualified to fill the

temporary vacancy.

35
If this procedure is violated by anyone under the rank of Commander, there will
not be any grievances accepted by the FOP, and the City will not be required to

pay any amount to the lieutenant/sergeant who was not offered the overtime.

B. Effective January 1, 2010, the City discontinued providing short-term disability benefits
and long term benefits for the members of the bargaining unit. Officers who are unable to
work due to illness or injury must utilize all available paid time off, including vacation,
before going on unpaid status. An officer who is on unpaid status due to a disability and
who does not have banked sick days may qualify to use time from the Disability Leave

Bank as set forth below:

1. Officers without sick time accumulated prior to December 31, 2004, will be
eligible to donate accrued Personal Days or Vacation Leave to a personal

Disability Leave Bank.

il. Officers may make an irrevocable donation of accrued Personal Days, Deferred
Holiday, or Vacation Leave during the month of December to a personal

Disability Leave Bank. Donations shall be made in 8-hour increments.

45
iil. Each eligible officer shall be able to accrue no more than one hundred and sixty

(160) hours in their Disability Leave Bank at any time.

iv. An officer shall not utilize any accumulated paid leave until 14 consecutive

calendar days of disability.

Vv. To qualify to use Disability Leave Bank time, the disability must be certified by a
licensed medical care provider and must be certified as a non-work related injury

or illness.
Vi. The officer shall be compensated at the current hourly rate at the time of usage.

vil. Officers shall not be eligible to contribute to or utilize Disability Bank time until
they have completed six months of continuous full-time (non-probationary)

employment

viti. | Unused Disability Leave time shall not be paid out upon separation from

employment.

Each qualified officer will receive ten (10) personal days each calendar year.

Personal days may be accrued and carried over from year to year up to a maximum of 150
days, but the City will not pay for any such accrued days, and unused days will be forfeited,
except that upon retirement, the City will pay in a lump sum for up to twenty (20) accrued
personal days. The lump sum payment for personal days will be equal to the number of
accumulated personal days (up to twenty) times eight (8) hours, times the standard hourly

wage rate for the permanent position held by the employee on the date of his retirement.

Effective January 1, 2005, the sick leave plan including accrued sick days will be
discontinued. Any officer who has accrued sick days as of December 31, 2004, may freeze
the number of sick days in a bank. These sick days may be used during the waiting period
before disability benefits. Upon retirement, the City will buy back 100% of the number of
accrued whole sick days. The lump sum payment for accumulated sick days upon

retirement shall be equal to the number of accumulated whole sick days times eight (8)

46
times the standard hourly wage rate for the permanent position held by the officer on the

date of retirement.

1.

The employee who banked sick days prior to January 1, 2005 must have the
required length of service for retirement or be eligible for disability retirement at
the time of terminating employment with the City in order to be eligible for

payment on retirement for accumulated sick leave.

An employee who banked sick days prior to January 1, 2005, who, while eligible
for retirement, dies while still employed will be paid for any unused sick leave time

he or she has accumulated as of the date of his or her death.

The beneficiary or estate of an employee who dies in the line of duty will receive a
lump sum payment equal to the number of accumulated sick leave days up to one

hundred and fifty (150) days.

The lump sum payment shall be equal to the number of accumulated sick leave days
times eight (8) times the standard hourly wage rate for the permanent position held

by the employee on the date of retirement.

The City may require medical certification that an employee was physically unable to

perform his or her duties because of illness or other physical disability if the employee is

off for more than three (3) consecutive days.

Itis understood and agreed that, the City may establish, and require compliance with, such

regulations as shall be reasonable and necessary to prevent any abuse of sick leave, by an

employee.

It is understood and agreed, further, that the City may require medical certification of

illness before any sick leave payments are made to any employee whose prior pattem of

sick leave usage makes it apparent that the benefit is being abused, at the time.

47
Personal leave time off must be requested in writing at least seventy-two (72) hours in
advance of time requested unless due to sudden illness or emergency. Such requests for
personal leave time off shall be responded to by the City within forty-eight (48) hours of
the request. Final discretion to schedule personal leave time off shall rest with the City,
but such requests shall not be arbitrarily or capriciously denied. In the event that more
requests are received than can be allowed for the same day, then the time off shall be
awarded on the basis of seniority. The officer’s shift lieutenant will have the discretion to
deviate from the 72 hour notice referenced in COP #03-549 under appropriate
circumstances, provided the lieutenant documents the time the personal leave request was

received and the reason it was granted (i.e., sufficient scheduled manpower on duty).

Forces or the National Guard shall be eligible for Military Leave with no loss of pay for

such period not in excess of fifteen (15) calendar days in any calendar year.

her regular duties during the actual period of such jury duty and shall receive the difference
between any jury duty compensation received and his or her regular wage for each day of

jury service.

REHABILITATION PROGRAM

Officers requiring rehabilitation for drug and alcohol related problems shall be granted up
to twenty-eight (28) days of leave which may, at the officer’s option, be deducted from any
accumulated leaves such as vacation, sick leave (etc.). If within six (6) months after
successful completion of the program and retum to duty that officer uses not more than
seven (7) days of sick leave, all paid leave utilized shall be restored to the officer. Officers

may avail themselves of this program only once.

48
FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE

The provisions of the City’s Family and Medical Leave Act policy are incorporated by
reference herein. Any employee who is eligible for Family and Medical Leave in
accordance with the City’s Family and Medical Leave Act policy may take up to twelve

weeks of time.

The twelve (12) week period shall include any appropriate paid leave the employee is
entitled to use plus unpaid leave to total no more than twelve (12) weeks in a twelve (12)
month period except as otherwise set forth in the City’s policy.

Requests for unpaid leave must be in writing and shall indicate the purpose of the leave

request and the approximate length of leave.

Employees shall not have an interruption of their continuous service while on unpaid leave.

ONE DAY WORK RULE MODIFICATION

A. An officer may be permitted to use vacation, personal days, DH days, VD days
and AP days accrued in the New Year without satisfying the One Day Work
Rule provided:

(1) the officer makes a written request to his Commander in advance of the

vacation period specifying

(a) the last date he will work in the expiring year before commencing

vacation and

(b) the date of his return to work in the New Year;

(2) the request must be approved in writing by the Commander in

advance of the officer commencing the vacation; and

49
(3) the officer must physically work his/her entire shifts on the last date before
vacation and the date of return as stated in the written request submitted to

the Commander.

Where the Commander has granted the request, but an officer subsequently fails
to work the specific shifts identified in writing at the time of request, the officer
will be marked “xX” for days absent in the New Year as required by the One Day
Work Rule.

B. Further, when the Bureau determines that an officer is properly marked
“Holiday” on January 1, the One Day Work Rule is waived for vacation, personal
days, DH days, VD days and AP days commencing January 2, provided the
Officer complies with the procedure and attendance requirements stated in the

paragraph above.

Example: (1) Officer submits memo to Commander on Dec. 13, 2002 requesting
vacation from Friday Dec. 27, 2002 through Friday January 3, 2003; (2) The
memo must specify the last date the officer will physically work in the expiring
year and the date of return to work in the New Year; (3) Failure to physically
work on the date of return stated in the request will result in application of the
One Day Work Rule, i.e., the officer will be marked “X” (absent without pay)
or “Y” (AWOL), as appropriate, for days absent in the New Year.

Any officer who is on leave of absence for which he or she does not receive wages from
the City shall be responsible to pay the employee contribution portion of his benefits.
The only acceptable form of payment will be a personal check or money order made

payable to the Treasurer, City of Pittsburgh.

for an amount equal to the employee’s annual base salary rounded off to the next
highest hundred dollars of Group Life Insurance with double indemnity during the
employee’s employment with the City of Pittsburgh during the term of this
Agreement. The City shall pay the full cost of such insurance including any rate

increases which occur during the term of this Agreement.

Each employee who retires during the term of this Agreement shall, upon such
retirement, be provided seven thousand five hundred ($7,500) dollars of life
insurance coverage, to include such coverage as provided under any disability

retirement benefits granted under the Pension Plan in effect on January 1, 1976.

B. HEALTH INSURANCE

I.

1.

a.

Active Police Officer Health Insurance

The City will continue to offer the current two health care plan designs,
the Basic Plan (“Next Generation PPO 90/10 Plan’) and Premier Plan
(mirroring the current 2019 benefits provided to active fire fighters,
regardless of future changes in the Fire Plan). The police plan benefits

shall not change because the Fire Fighter’s Plan changed.

Effective January 1, 2019, police officers shall contribute sixteen and one-
half (16.5%) percent of the annual cost/ premium for health insurance,
vision care and the dental plan. The calculation of the employee
contribution of 16.5% shall be in accordance with the prior arbitration

awards of Arbitrator Jane Desimone (10/5/2018), Arbitrator Michael

52
Zobrak (3/22/07) and Arbitrator John Skonier (12/30/2004); while self-
insured, the trending and fluctuation margins/fees shall not be applied in
determining the annual cost/premium nor shall there be a surcharge such

as the 2% levied in the past.

c. The City has the right to purchase fully insured health care plans and to
continue the 16.5 percent of actual premium charged or to self-insure for

the purposes of health care coverage.

d. It is recognized that the City will make annual adjustments to the contribution
amounts based upon the calculation as set forth in paragraph b (of Section

14(B)(I)(1) above)

e. The FOP may utilize the grievance procedure to challenge the amount of any annual

adjustment.

f. The City has the right to purchase fully insured health care plans or to self-insure

for the purposes of health care coverage.

The City shall have the right to change the existing medical, surgical, and hospitalization
insurance plan, which is comparable to the coverage presently being provided. The FOP,
however, retains the right to grieve the City’s determination that the plan is comparable. If
the FOP does not agree that a plan selected by the City is comparable it will so state, in
writing, to the City within fourteen (14) days of the plan being provided to the FOP by the
City, or such longer period as mutually agreed to by the parties. In that event, the City may
not unilaterally implement the proposed new plan, however, it may immediately process
the dispute before a neutral arbitrator selected pursuant to the arbitration step of the
grievance procedure. The decision of the arbitrator on this comparability issue shall be
issued within forty-five (45) calendar days of the FOP’s written notice contesting that the
plan selected by the City is comparable and shall be final and binding and will determine

if the City is authorized to implement a new plan.

53
If the City receives notice or information indicating that its health care plan costs will
subject the plan to the Affordable Care Act’s “Cadillac Tax” excise tax, the City will give
the FOP written notice of that fact and the parties will immediately meet to discuss changes
in the plan design, plan and/or plan carrier in order to avoid the imposition of the tax. If
no agreement is reached within fourteen (14) days of the City’s written notice to the FOP
regarding this issue, then the parties will proceed to an expedited arbitration proceeding
with an arbitrator selected pursuant to the terms of the Working Agreement’s grievance
and arbitration procedure. The sole purpose for that expedited arbitration proceeding will
be for the arbitrator to modify the plan, plan design and/or plan carrier in order to eliminate
the exposure to the Cadillac Tax. The decision of the arbitrator on this issue shall be issued

within forty (40) calendar days of his or her appointment.

Future pre-Medicare retirees, provided they were hired prior to January 1, 2005,

will be offered the same plan choices as active employees.

Existing pre-Medicare retirees will be offered the active employee choices as an

option.

Employees may make an election of health care plan, as provided under Section 14-B-

1, at least once each year, at a time determined by the City.

a. Ifan employee covered under this agreement, is married to another
employee of the City, only one employee shall receive health insurance
coverage through the City. The employee that receives health insurance through
the City shall provide health insurance coverage for both City employees and
eligible dependents. The employees involved may decide which employee will
receive such insurance. If the employee covered under this agreement does not
receive health insurance coverage through the City, he or she may enroll in the

waiver program explained in Section 14(B)(5)(c).

b. Ifan employee, covered under this agreement, is married to an individual

who has health insurance coverage through an employer other than the City, the

54
City employee may waive health insurance coverage through the City. If the
employee covered under this agreement does not receive health insurance
coverage through the City, he or she may enroll in the waiver program

explained in Section 14 (B)(5)(c).

c. The City will only accept a waiver of health insurance coverage if the
employee provides proof that he or she is enrolled in another health insurance
plan. Acceptable proof will be an enrollment card with the subscriber’s name,
identification number (Social Security Number) and group number. The City
reserves the right to verify that the employee is enrolled in another health

insurance plan.

An employee will be able to waive his/her health insurance coverage during

the annual open enrollment period or within 31 days after incurring a change

in life or family status. Changes in life and family status are those listed

below.

provide the City’s Employee Compensation Office written notice of such

change. An employee will only be permitted to re-enroll in the City’s health

insurance program if such a change causes the employee waiving health

insurance coverage to lose his or her other health insurance coverage. Re-

enrollment into the City’s health insurance program will be effective so as

to prevent a lapse in coverage. The City will require proof that the life and

family status change has occurred.

In the event an officer is “killed in service,” health care coverage identical

to that offered to active police officers shall be granted, without

contribution, to the officer’s surviving spouse and surviving dependents.

Common law spouses and domestic partners shall be included within the

definition of family and shall be eligible for health insurance, dental

insurance and vision care in accordance with the following terms and

conditions:

marriage. Employees shall show appropriate documentation
demonstrating the dissolution of a common law marriage before
seeking benefits under this section for a new common law spouse.

1.e. joint utility bills, joint bank accounts, joint leases, etc.

will be eligible for benefits under the domestic partner/ecommon law spouse benefits program.

Cross/Blue Shield/Major Medical Insurance coverage
through the City of Pittsburgh. The City shall contribute
towards the cost of this coverage, for each employee so
electing, an amount equal to the amount charged by Blue
Cross/Blue Shield for individual coverage under this plan

and the provisions of Appendix D of the 1992 Working

58
Agreement, as added by the award of Edward E. McDaniel,
on December 22, 1979 shall not apply.

period. Any retiree who terminates his/her Husband and
Wife BC/BS/MM Indemnity plan for a managed care plan
will be permitted to re-enroll in the BC/BS/MM Indemnity
Plan only once. During a future open enrollment period, any
subsequent termination of the BC/BS/MM Indemnity plan
for a managed care plan will be irrevocable. Such an
election into a managed care health insurance plan will be

voluntary.

pension deduction will be the difference between the
Individual rate paid by the City at the time of retirement and

insurance coverage is terminated if the employee is or becomes employed
or self-employed or has access to private medical insurance coverage or
Medicare through his/her spouse or if his/her spouse has private medical

termination of his/her health insurance benefits within thirty (30)

days of the termination in order to ensure no lapse in coverage.

coverage or access to other coverage which the retiree and/or spouse
has failed to report to the City, City provided health insurance will

be permanently terminated.

the Police Officer’s spouse. Each retired Police Officer, upon
reaching age 65, must provide the City with proof acceptable to the
City that the Police Officer is not eligible for Medicare benefits,
either directly or through his/her spouse. If sufficient proof is not
provided, the City’s obligation will be to fund the Medicare
supplement benefit provided by Blue Cross of Westem
Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Blue Shield (BC/BS).

62
subsequent increases, providing the retiree, and his/her spouse,
apply for Medicare Part A & B benefits prior to first becoming

his/her spouse, make a late application for Medicare Part A & B

benefits.

the health insurer of last resort. As the health insurer of last resort, the City
will provide health insurance benefits for a Police Officer and his/her spouse
who retires after January 1, 1996, where such Police Officer and his/her

insurance coverage for himself/herself and spouse only, through the City.
The City shall contribute towards the cost of this husband and wife
coverage, for each employee so electing, an amount equal to the amount

date of his/her retirement. The plan(s) that the City will provide are the

same plan choices provided to active employees described in Section 14

11. Any officer hired after January 1, 2005 will not be entitled to any retiree
health care benefits provided by the City after his/her retirement.

The City will establish a dedicated account or trust fund for purposes of funding
post-retirement health care benefits for police officers hired after December 31,
2004. The term “retired” for this benefit will include officers who do not satisfy
superannuation retirement eligibility, but are determined to be eligible for a
disability retirement by virtue of their medical condition. The trust fund shall be
established, managed and operated in the manner determined by the City pursuant

to applicable law.

(b.) The City shall continue to make a monthly contribution into the trust fund in
an amount equal to two (2.0)% of a Master Police Officer's base salary (excluding
overtime, secondary employment or any other pay or differential that may be used
for purposes of computing an officer’s overtime rate) per full-time non-
probationary employee per month on behalf of all employees hired after December
31, 2004 and through December 31, 2015; provided that the number will not go
below 300 officers.. Effective January 1, 2021, the City shall increase the monthly
contribution to 4.0% of a Master Police Officer’s base salary (excluding overtime,
secondary employment or any other pay or differential that may be used for
purposes of computing an Officer’s overtime rate) per full-time non-probationary
employee per month on behalf of all employees hired after December 31, 2004 and
through December 31, 2015; provided that the number will not go below 300

71
Officers. Pursuant to the Award of Arbitrator Miles, this number may be reduced
by attrition, but not below 300 Officers. For example, in 2016 the MPO rate salary
is $64,149, with a monthly salary of $5,346. Applying the 2% contribution
calculation, the City's payment into the OPEB fund would be 2% of $5,346 or
$107/month or $1,283/year. The $1,283 is then multiplied by the number of full-
time employees hired after December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2015.
Fund assets will be distributed by the City to assist retired Officers in their
purchasing of health care coverage. It is intended that the fund determine on a
periodic basis the amount that may be distributed to retired police Officers for the
purchase of coverage. No additional funds from the City will be required. There
is no guarantee of a specific level of coverage for employees hired between

December 31, 2004 who retire under the terms of this Agreement.

The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has a legal responsibility and management obligation to
ensure a safe work environment, as well as a paramount interest in protecting the public by
ensuring that its officers have the physical stamina and emotional stability to perform their

assigned duties.

The abuse of drugs and/or alcohol is destructive to the good order and reputation of the
Bureau of Police and will not be tolerated. Officers must have physical coordination and

unimpaired judgement to react prudently and effectively to the demands of police service.

PURPOSE:

This order states Police Bureau Policy relative to the use of narcotics, illegal drugs and the
abuse of alcohol and legally prescribed drugs by any member of the Pittsburgh Bureau of

Police and sets forth conditions in which drug tests will be required.

DEFINITIONS:

1. The term Drug included cannabis, narcotics, or controlled substances as defined

substance which has not been legally prescribed and/or dispensed, or the abuse of

a legally prescribed drug.

100
3. The term Alcohol includes beverages and medication or other substances

containing ethyl, methyl, isopropyl or other low molecular weight alcohol.

4, Reasonable Suspicion Standard — An apparent state of facts and/or circumstances
found to exist by a supervisor which would cause a reasonably intelligent person to
believe the employee to be under the influence or a user of drugs or narcotics. The

standard of reasonable suspicion is less than probable cause.

5. Drug And/Or Alcohol Testing — The use of intoxilyzer, urinalysis, hair testing or
any other clinically accepted method of detecting drugs and/or alcohol in the human

body.

D. GENERAL RULES:

1. The use of illegal drugs, cannabis, or non-prescribed controlled substances or the
abuse of legally prescribed drugs or controlled substances by a member of the
Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is strictly prohibited. In addition, members are

prohibited from being under the influence of alcohol while on duty.

Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action.

2. Refusal by a Police Officer to take the required drug and/or alcohol testing shall be
considered insubordination and will result in the immediate relief from his/her
police duties pending disposition of any administrative action. Pursuant to Civil

Service Rule III, the Officer will be ordered to take a Civil Service Medical Exam.

101
3. The Department, upon notification of the refusal of a Police Officer to take the

medical examination, shall mark the Officer as absent without permission.

E; MANDATORY DRUG TESTING:

For mandatory drug testing the City may use intoxilyzer, urinalysis, hair testing or any

other clinically accepted method of detecting drugs and/or alcohol in the human body.

Mandatory drug and/or alcohol testing will be conducted only upon the approval of a
Commander, Assistant or Deputy Chief, Chief of Police, or pursuant to Civil Service

regulations under the following circumstances:

was incapable of performing his or her required duties or exhibited unusual work

performance measures and/or behavioral traits.

handlers and drug-dog trainers.

102
5. Random testing twice each year for personnel assigned to special units as listed

above.

6. When an Officer is scheduled for a physical examination to return to duty after an
absence of 15 days or more which normally requires a physical examination and

the Officer has a record of excessive absenteeism.

7. Within a reasonable period of time following an officer’s involvement in an on-
duty vehicular accident which is reportable under the Motor Vehicle Code. An
officer will be drug and/or alcohol tested for involvement in an on-duty vehicular
accident which is reportable under the Motor Vehicle Code only if the officer was
actually operating the vehicle at the time of the accident. Testing must be
conducted in a dignified manner, which shall afford an officer privacy. An officer
taken for immediate, necessary medical treatment, as a result of a vehicle accident
or a shooting, shall not have said medical treatment postponed until testing can be
performed. Any violation of an officer’s rights under this section shall entitle the

FOP to one day of additional President’s time.

BE. PROCEDURES FOR THE ORDERING OF DRUG AND/OR ALCOHOL TESTING IN
CASES OF REASONABLE SUSPICION:

1, A ranking officer (Commander or above) will be notified by the initiating

supervisor of the circumstances leading to the request for testing.

103
If the request is approved, the supervisor requesting the testing will direct a memo
to the Commander or other ranking officer indicating the circumstances of
reasonable suspicion which formed the basis of the request. If the basis for the
request includes an infraction of the rules and regulations, a Disciplinary Action

Report (DAR) will accompany the request.

The Bureau will strive, absent exigent circumstances, to provide the written
explanation at the time an officer is ordered to produce a specimen for reasonable
suspicion testing. The memo will then be presented to the accused Officer who will
sign his or her name to the bottom of the report indicating that they have read it.
This signature will in no way be considered an admission of guilt, but only an
acknowledgment of the fact that the report was read. A copy of this report will be

given to the accused Officer.

An accused Officer who refuses to submit to properly required drug and/or alcohol
testing shall be deemed insubordinate; and, charges shall be proffered by the
requesting supervisor or other commanding officer, and the accused Officer will be

transported home.

If the accused Officer agrees to drug and/or alcohol testing, the Officer shall
complete and sign the consent form. If the accused Officer is unable to read the
consent form, the supervisor shall read it to the Officer. The yellow copy of the
consent form will be given to the accused Officer. The supervisor will retain the

white copy of the consent form.

A supervisor will transport the accused Officer to the approved testing facility and

will stand by until the test has been administered and will then transport the Officer

104
home. At the testing facility, the supervisor shall complete and sign the laboratory
request form for the drug test indicating the name of the accused Officer to be tested
and the telephone number of the Chief of Police or his designee who 1s the person

to be contacted when the results of the drug tests are available.

Breath alcohol testing will be carried out in accordance with DOT standards.

Upon completion of the drug test, a copy of all police reports will be forwarded

through the chain of command to the Chief of Police.

ALLEGATIONS OF MISCELLANEOUS DRUG-RELATED ACTIVITY ON OR OFF
DUTY:

Allegations of miscellaneous drug-related activity which could be considered reasonable

suspicion requiring a drug test include, but are not limited to, the following:

1,

Illegal sale, delivery, manufacture, purchase, or possession of drugs and narcotics.

Whenever the results of a preliminary criminal investigation indicate a reasonable
suspicion to believe that the accused Officer is involved in illegal drug-related
activity; or upon completion of the initial stages of an administrative investigation
which indicates a reasonable suspicion to believe that the accused Officer is
personally using illegal drugs or is personally misusing or abusing legally

prescribed or dispensed medications.
A reasonable suspicion exists when a person has a reasonable belief that an

individual is under the influence of a drug which affects behavior, supportable by

direct observation, articulable reasons and common sense.
