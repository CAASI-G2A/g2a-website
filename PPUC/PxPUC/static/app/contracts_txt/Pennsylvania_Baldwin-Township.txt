as a paramount consideration in scheduling officers for duty.

employment that results in the number of total fulltime law enforcement employees (including
the Chief) falling below five (5) members, the Township shall have the right in its discretion
to procure and utilize the services of part-time officers for no more than thirty (30) hours per
week, and the Township may continue to utilize such part-time officer(s) for a period of up to
