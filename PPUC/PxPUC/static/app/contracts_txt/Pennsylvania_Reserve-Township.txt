The presence of any detectable amount of prohibited substances in the employee's system while at work, while on the premises of the Township or its residents, or while on Township business. "Prohibited substances" include illegal drugs, alcohol, or prescription drugs not taken in accordance with a prescription given to the employee. 

Reserve Township will conduct drug and/or alcohol testing under any ofthe following circumstances:

Means not only the one who was or could have been injured, but also any employee 
who potentially contributed to the accident or injury event in any way. If an employee is tested for drugs or alcohol outside of the employment context and the results indicate a violation ofthis policy, or if an employee refuses a request to submit to testing under this policy, the employee may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and possibly including discharge from employment. In such a case, the employee will be given an opportunity to explain the circumstances prior to any final employment action becoming effective.
