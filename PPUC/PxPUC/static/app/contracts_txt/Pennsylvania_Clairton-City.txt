CITY OF CLAIRTON DRUG & ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAM 
It is the goal of the City of Clairton to provide a safe workplace by eliminating the potential hazards to health and job safety created by drug and alcohol abuse. The City has no intention of intruding into the private lives of its employees. However we realize that involvement with drugs and / or alcohol off the job eventually takes its toll on job performance. Our concern is to assure that employees report to work in a condition so as to be able to perform their duties safely and efficiently in the interest of their fellow workers, the community as a whole and themselves. 
PROHIBITED CONDUCT 
Any employee found to be unlawfully using, manufacturing, selling, distributing, dispensing, possessing, purchasing, trafficking in or under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug while performing assigned duties for the City of Clairton will be considered to be in violation of this policy.

POLICY VIOLATION 
Employees violating this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination.

The City reserves the right to search employee's personal effects brought onto City property along with the employee's work area, when an employee is reasonably suspected of being involved in alcohol, drug, or controlled substance abuse activities. Employees must notify the City Manager of any criminal drug statute conviction within five ( 5) calendar days after the conviction. City Manager must report and drug statute conviction to the Mayor. 
In the case of abuse of drugs or alcohol, the City will use constructive disciplinary measures to motivate the employee to seek assistance and will direct said employee to appropriate resources available in the community. Normal City benefits available to any employee, such as sick leave and the group medical plan, are available to aid in the rehabilitation process. If the available assistance prograrn(s) fail, assistance is inappropriate given the nature of the infraction, for example sale or distribution to other employees or the general public while on City time, or the employee's position is one that requires a zero tolerance of substance abuse, the penalty for substance abuse may be termination of employment.
