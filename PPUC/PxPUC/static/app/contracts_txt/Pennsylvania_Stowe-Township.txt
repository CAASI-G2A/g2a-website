The parties hereto agree that the present pension and retirement programs as prescribed by
applicable State Law (Act 600 and Amendments) and all Provisions of the Stowe Township
Ordinance shall continue in full force and effect as modified herein.

Section A.

L. “Final Monthly Average Salary Average” of said pension is to be calculated on the basis
of the Employee’s last thirty-six (36) months of employment immediately preceding
termination of active employment. The Final Monthly Average Salary shall be calculated
by taking into account only those periods during which a member/employee receives
salary, as that term is defined in this section or those periods during which Workers’
Compensation benefits are received, if applicable.

2. Monthly Retirement Amount — The normal monthly retirement benefit shall be equal to
Fifty (50%) Percent of the Employee’s final monthly average salary.

3. Survivor's Benefit — There shall be “survivor’s benefit” to Fifty (50%) Percent of the
participants benefit, payable to a surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse’s life.
If there is no surviving spouse or if the spouse dies, the participants children would have
equal shares in the benefit until the age of eighteen (18), or until age twenty-three (23) if
attending college (minimum of seven (7) credits per semester).

4. Death of an Officer Prior to Vesting — Before the amendment of Act 600, if an Officer died
prior to completing twelve (12) years of service, the surviving spouse or dependent children
received nothing. Under Act 30, if an Officer dies prior to vesting his/her pension, the
surviving spouse or, if the spouse is deceased, any child or children under the age of
eighteen (18) or twenty-three (23) if attending college, is entitled to one hundred (100%)
percent of the Officers employee contribution plus interest, unless the Officer has
designated another beneficiary. This benefit is not available for the survivors of an Officer
who died prior to April 17, 2002.

5. Killed in Service Benefit — Pension for families of members killed in service shall be
calculated at one hundred (100%) percent of the Officer’s salary at the time of death with

12.

Police Pension Plan Contribution — Each Police Officer shall contribute:

a. 2015 - 5%, which would = 1.5%
b. 2016 - .5%, which would =2% Max

Vesting After Twelve (12) Years of Service — There shall be a provision for one hundred
(100%) percent “vesting after twelve (12) years of service”, so that an eligible participant
would receive a benefit at a normal retirement equal to their accrued benefit, which would
be defined as fifty (50%) percent of the final monthly average salary calculated at the date
of termination.

Length of Service Increment — In addition to any other pension or retirement coverage,
additional retirement benefits may accrue to participants for each year of completion of
twenty-six (26) years with the Stowe Township Police Department. The maximum
additional benefit may not exceed One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars per month.

Cost of Living Adjustment — Stowe Township hereby prescribes that cost of living (COLA)
allowances shall be payable to retired members, however, such amount shall not exceed
the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the year in which the
police member last worked, provided further, that in no case shall the total police pension
benefit exceed seventy-five (75%) percent of the salary for computing retirement benefits;
and provided further, that the total cost of living increase shall not exceed thirty (30%)
percent. No COLA shall be granted which would impair the actuarial soundness of the
fund.

New Service Related Disability Benefit. Before the passage of Act 30, an Officer who
suffered a permanent service-related disability was entitled to receive a disability pension
benefit. The amount of the benefit was not specified and was subject to collective
bargaining. Some Municipalities chose to provide a flat percentage regardless of service,
for example, fifty (50%) percent of final average salary; other Municipalities elected to
have a variable benefit based upon years of service, for example, two (2%) percent of an
Officer’s final average salary for every year of service. Act 30 established a monthly
service-related disability benefit of no less that fifty (50%) percent of the Officer’s salary
at the time of disability. This benefit is not applicable retroactively to Officers who have
already been honorably discharges with a service connected disability benefit which is less
than fifty (50%) percent.

been employed as such for at least six (6) months, and who enters active military service
for the United States, must receive retirement credit for the period of active military service.
To be eligible, the person must return to employment within six (6) months of separation
from such military service and be ineligible to receive military retirement pay as a result
of that service.
