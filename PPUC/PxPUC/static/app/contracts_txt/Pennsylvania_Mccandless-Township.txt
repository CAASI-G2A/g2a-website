program and contributions will not be deducted from wages during that year. In the event a

Police Patrol Officer returns to the Town's medical program, this amount will be prorated

-20-
in accordance with the number of months there was no coverage. Subject to insurance
provided regulations, the Police Patrol Officer may re-enter the Town medical program at
any time. In the event a Police Patrol Officer discontinues his employment, this amount will
be prorated in accordance with the number of months there was no coverage and will be

paid with the last paycheck the officer is entitled to receive.

5. Each Police Patrol Officer covered under the Town's health insurance
plan shail contribute toward the cost of the plan as follows: 7.0% of premium beginning on
January 1, 2019. The existing $150 per month cap on such contributions shall be

eliminated.

B. Affordable Care Act

At the time of execution of this Agreement, considerable uncertainty
concerning the details and effect of the Federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) exists.
Particularly, the federal agencies with jurisdiction have yet to issue final regulations
concerning many of the provisions and terms of the ACA. For example, a notice requirement
concerning ACA’s health insurance exchanges has been delayed, and regulations which will
define those ACA health insurance exchanges have not yet been issued. In order to overcome
this uncertainty, the parties have negotiated this Agreement based upon the mutual belief
and premise that the health care plan and benefits being provided to the Police Officers
under this Agreement will be in compliance with any requirements of the ACA concerning
essential health benefits and will not constitute a “Cadillac plan” for purposes of requiring
the Town to pay a 40% excise tax, and will not have adverse economic consequences to the
parties which are not currently known. In the event that either the Town of McCandless or
the Police Officers suffer a material negative economic impact as a result of the ACA, or any
regulations promulgated by the federal agencies with jurisdiction thereunder, or any action
taken or not taken by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a result of its concurrent
authority or jurisdiction under the ACA, then the parties agree to negotiate over possible
amendments to this Agreement to address said material negative economic consequences in
accordance with Act 111 of 1968, including interest arbitration if necessary. The scope of

any such negotiations or Act 111 arbitration proceedings shall be limited to possible

-21-
amendments to the health insurance provisions of the Agreement, which will address the

effects of any material negative economic impacts caused by the ACA, as stated above.

provided however, the reimbursement to the retiree shall not exceed the amount paid by the
Town for individual coverage or, if applicable, husband and wife coverage, at the rate in effect

The retiree may elect to continue any statutory coverage (i.e., current COBRA
benefits) that allows a period of continued coverage upon an employer health insurance
plan. When such coverage ends, the retiree shall submit documentation of health insurance
coverage which the retiree obtains, and the costs thereof, in order to receive the Town's

reimbursement for such coverage.

twenty (20) years of service will receive the applicable retiree health insurance
reimbursement prorated in the same manner as the actuarially-reduced Act 24 benefit. The
Officer must otherwise satisfy the eligibility requirements stated above. The applicable
benefit wil! be the amount that is paid on behalf of the Officer by the Town on the last day of
employment.

(a) Any Police Patrol Officer who believes that he or she has a
justifiable complaint may promptly discuss the complaint with his/her Officer-in-Charge,
with or without a MPOA representative present, as the Police Patrol Officer may elect, in an
effort to resolve it. The Police Patrol Officer may, instead, report the matter directly to the
McCandless Pelice Officers Association representative who, then, may take the matter up
with the Officer-in-Charge, in a sincere effort toward settlement. The affected Police Patrol
Officer should be present in any such discussion, however, if he or she is available. The

Officer-in-Charge shall have authority to settle the complaint, upon authorization of the Chief

-46-
of Police, and shall render his/her response thereto within three (3) days of the discussion

on the matter, in each case.

The MPOA representative of the complaining Police Patrol Officer, also,
shall have the authority to settle or withdraw the complaint. If a complaint is not resolved
through oral discussion, however, it may be reduced to written grievance, on a form
provided by the Town, which shall (among other items) include the signature of a MPOA
representative and be filed with the Chief of Police.

Step II

(a) To be considered in Step II hereof, any written and signed grievance

and his or her MPOA representative and will respond thereto, in writing, within ten (10)
calendar days of the receipt of the written grievance. If the Chief of Police does not respond

shall be considered denied, without necessity for further appeal. The Town Manager and

designated representative) have not answered, in either such period, the grievance shall be
considered denied, without necessity for further appeal. If the Council's Step IV decision is

provisions of this section, but which, satisfactorily, has not been resolved; and, properly, has
been appealed therefor, may be submitted to arbitration before an impartial arbitrator to be
selected by mutual agreement of the parties. A grievance not submitted for arbitration
within thirty (30) days after the Council level decision is rendered would remain in effect as
decided at the Council level. If within ten (10) work days (or other time limit mutually agreed
upon) after receipt of any proper appeal, the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator,
the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mediation shall be requested to furnish a list of seven (7)
disinterested persons qualified and willing to act as impartial arbitrators. For such list, the

MPOA and the Town shall, in that order, strike one name, until all but one (1) has been

- 48 -
eliminated. The person whose name remains on the list shall be selected to act as impartial
arbitrator.

2. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, modify
or disregard any provisions of the parties’ agreement, except to the extent that any such

provision may be in conflict with State and/or Federal law.

3. The fees and expenses of arbitration shall be borne in equal shares by
the Town and the MPOA.
