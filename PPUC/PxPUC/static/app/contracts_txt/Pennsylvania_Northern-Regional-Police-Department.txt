HEAL TH BENEFITS

4.1 Medical Benefits
a.

The Joint Police Board will provide major medical coverage for all full-time
officers and their dependents subject to changes imposed by the carrier. The
Police Board may change plans and/or carriers to "substantially comparable"
coverage. Substantially comparable coverage in this contract does not mean
equal or equivalent. The Union however, retains the right to grieve the Joint
Police Board's detennination that the plan and/or carrier is "substantially
comparable." When the Joint Police Board decides to change the plan, it will
provide the Union with details of the current plan and the new "substantially
comparable" plan. If the Union does not agree that a plan or carrier selected by
the Joint Police Board is "substantially comparable," it will so state, in writing,
to the Joint Police Board within fourteen (14) calendar days of the plan and/or
provider being presented to the Union by the Joint Police Board, or such longer
period as mutually agreed to by the parties in writing. In that event, the Joint
Police Board may not unilaterally implement the proposed new plan and/or
insurance provider; however, it may immediately process the dispute before a
neutral arbitrator selected pursuant to the arbitration step of the grievance
procedure. The decision of the arbitrator on this "'substantially comparable"
issue shall be issued within 45 calendar days of the Union's written notice
contesting that the plan selected by the Joint Police Board is "substantially
comparable" and shall be final and binding and will detennine if the Joint Police
Board is authorized to implement the new plan or provider.

b.

All full-time police officers will contribute, on a cumulative basis, fifteen per
cent (15%) of the annual increases to hospitalization/surgical/major

medical

costs above the 20 IO rate at the applicable level of coverage (eg. Individual,
family, etc.) All such contributions shall be made by prorated monthly payroll
deductions.

Section V.

a.

SICK LEAVE
All full-time officers shall be entitled to receive 100% of their base pay for
absences due to routine illness and injuries of a short duration, including the
waiting period prior to becoming eligible for STD benefits.

b.

Sick leave shall not be considered a privilege, but will be allowed only in the
event of personal illness or physical incapacity resulting from causes beyond the
officers control. Accordingly, sick leave is not an entitlement like vacation
leave, and it shall not be treated as such. Sick leave abuse is a serious
disciplinary offense which may subject the abuser to corrective action up to and
including dismissal.

c.

A doctor's certificate or cogent medical explanation shall be presented by the
police officer to the Chief of Police in the following instances:
i)

After two (2) consecutive days of sick leave

iii)

After eight (8) sick leaves in any year.

iv)

When an officer takes a sick leave for the next regularly scheduled shift
immediately following an overtime detail.

v)

After an officer takes a sick leave in conjunction with other paid time off
or pass days more than two (2) times in a calendar year.

vi)

For purposes of this section a sick leave will be defined as a sick day or
days uninterrupted by a day of work.

vii)

A cogent medical explanation is one which comes from a competent
medical practitioner, who demonstrates knowledge of the essential
functions of the employee's job, and who provide sufficient detail so that
a reasonable lay person can understand the asserted basis for the
absence. A conclusory statement that the employee was unable to report
to work due to illness will not be satisfactory. Cogent medical
explanations will be required for subsections (iii), (iv) and (v) above.

IS

d.

In the following instances, the officer will be subject to an administrative
review:

i)

An officer who takes more than eight (8) sick leaves in any year.

ii)

An officer who takes sick leave in conjunction with other paid time off or
pass days more than two (2) times in a calendar year.

iii)

An officer who takes sick leave for the next regularly scheduled shift
following an overtime detail and fails to provide a cogent medical
explanation.

iv)

If, as a result of this review, it is found that the officer has improperly
used sick time, they will forfeit their right to detail and private contract
overtime for the 6-month period immediately following the finding.
They will still be eligible for shift overtime.

e.

An officer who takes sick leave for the regularly scheduled shift immediately
prior to a previously scheduled private contract overtime detail will forfeit that
detail, and it will be re-assigned to another officer.

f.

After an extended or severe illness, the Police Board may require certification
by a doctor that an officer is fit to return to work.

g.

Nothwithstanding the above-referenced general rules, the Joint Police Board
may counsel and/or discipline employees, for sick leave abuse where
occurrences, evidence a pattern of abuse. Examples of such abuse may include,
but are not limited to, single day occurrences of sick leave and sick leave
occurring contemporaneously with other forms of time off, either paid or
unpaid. Moreover, an employee with a history of such utilization may be
required to justify any request to utilize sick leave by providing a cogent
medical explanation for the absence.

16

h.

All full-time officers requesting sick leave payments shall be required to
complete and submit to the Chief of Police, the attached Sick Leave Request
form, immediatelyfollowing the officers' return to work, and prior to the end of
the payroll period.

If the Union does not agree that a plan or

carrier selected by the Joint Police Board is "substantially comparable," it will
so state, in writing, to the Joint Police Board within fourteen (14) calendar days
19

of the plan and/or provider being presented to the Union by the Joint Police
Board, or such longer period as mutually agreed to by the parties in writing. In
that event, the Joint Police Board may not unilaterally implement the proposed
new plan and/orinsurance provider; however, it may immediately process the
dispute before a neutral arbitrator selected pursuant to the arbitration step of the
grievance procedure.

The decision of the arbitrator on this "substantially

comparable" issue shall be issued within 45 calendar days of the Union's
written notice contesting that the plan selected by the Joint Police Board is
"substantially comparable" and shall be final and binding and will detennine if

by the insurance carriers and policies. If an officer has not returned to work at
the end of this fifty-two (52) or sixty-two (62) week period, he or she shall be
granted an honorable discharge from employment with the Department. In the
event that any officer recovers from disability and is medically cleared to return

(e) from the date they become eligible to receive long-term disability benefits.
The Joint Police Board shall be responsible for procuring the life insurance

subject to the grievance procedure. Eligibility for these insurance benefits will be
subject to the restrictions imposed by the insurance carriers and policies.

The

actuarially sound; and
3.

Any reduction or elimination of contributions is authorized on an
annual basis by an ordinance or resolution by the Board.

In the event of a reduction or elimination of participant pensions
contributions in any one year below the rate of 3.5 percent (3.5%), then
