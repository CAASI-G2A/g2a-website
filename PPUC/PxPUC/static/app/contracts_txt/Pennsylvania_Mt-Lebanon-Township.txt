iii
This Agreement is consistent with the Matter of Arbitration between Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania
and the United Police Society of Mt. Lebanon dated January 1, 2018.

This Agreement is entered into by and between Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, a municipal
subdivision of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (hereinafter referred to as the "Employer") and
the United Police Society of Mt. Lebanon (hereinafter referred to as the "Association"),
representing certain employees of the Mt. Lebanon Police Department (hereinafter referred to as
"Employee"). This Agreement shall become effective at 0001 hrs., January 1, 2018 and shall
continue in full effect until 2400 hrs., December 31, 2021.

ARTICLE I — GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.

Intent and Purpose.

It is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto that this Agreement will set forth the rates
of pay and other conditions of employment, and will promote and improve orderly and
peaceful relations between the parties in order to achieve uninterrupted operations in the
Police Department as well as the highest level of Employee performance consistent with
safety, good health and sustained effort.

Continuation of Service.

Since Article IX provides for arbitration of any unsettled grievance or dispute, and since
the Association recognizes that the services performed by the Employees are absolutely
essential to the public health, safety and welfare of the Municipality, the Association agrees
that it will not call, sanction, or engage in, nor will any of its Members participate in any
other collective or individual activity designed to disrupt the normal operations of said
Police Department. Any Employee participating in such action shall be subject to
immediate discharge at the discretion of the Chief of Police.

Definition of Employees.

For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "Employee" shall mean a member of the Mt.
Lebanon Police Department in the position of Police Officer, Corporal or Lieutenant who
is on the active payroll of said Department, but specifically excluding all positions above
the rank of Lieutenant and all clerical and nonsworn members of said Department.
Furthermore, the provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to any Employee during the
time that he is on active duty in any of the United States Armed Forces for a period in
excess of two calendar weeks per year. Words used in the masculine gender shall include
the feminine and the neuter.
Employer Rights.

The Employer shall have and retain, solely and exclusively, all managerial responsibilities,
functions and powers which shall include, but which shall not be limited to, the following:

a, The right to hire, suspend or discharge Employees for proper cause;

b. The right to lay off Employees because of lack of funds or lack of work, in order
of seniority, to the extent permitted by law;

c. Establishment or continuation of policies, practices, or procedures for the conduct
of Police Department, and, from time to time, change or abolishment of such
policies, practices, or procedures upon written notice to Employees;

d. Determination of the number of Employees to be employed or retained in
employment,
é. Determination of the amount of overtime required and scheduling in accordance

with Article III of this Agreement;
f. Determination of the work to be performed in any position;

g. Determination of work schedules, assignments, and shifts in accordance with
Article If of this Agreement;

h. Establishment and enforcement of reasonable rules for the maintenance of
discipline; and

i. Taking such other administrative measures as may be determined to be necessary
for the orderly, efficient, and equitable conduct of the Police Department.

Continuation of Authority.

The rights and responsibilities of the Civil Service Board and the Chief of Police with
respect to suspension, dismissal and demotions shall continue per statute; provided,
however, Employees may elect to challenge discipline via the grievance and arbitration
provisions of this Agreement instead of appealing to the Civil Service Commission, The
Union/Employee cannot pursue a matter simultaneously through Civil Service and the
grievance procedure. Whichever procedure is selected first by the Employee becomes the
exclusive procedure for use in resolving the dispute.

Compliance and Severability.

The public interest in the accomplishment of the purposes of the Police Department is
paramount. Therefore, in the administration of all matters covered by this Agreement,
officials and Employees are governed by the provisions of any existing and future laws or
regulations or amendments thereto including, without limitation, the provisions of the Mt.
Lebanon Civil Service Rules and Regulations and applicable statutes of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This Agreement is at all times to be applied and
construed subject to and in accordance with such laws, rules and regulations as they now
exist and as they may, from time to time, be amended. In the event that any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement shall be or shall become invalid by reason of any Federal or
State law, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect or impair any other terms or
provisions of this Agreement. Should any provisions become invalid by reason of Federal
or State action, the sections in question shall be subject to renegotiation between the
Employer and the Association.

ARTICLE I - HOURS OF WORK

1.

Definition of Work Day and Work Week.

A normal work day shall be eight (8) consecutive hours and fifteen (15) minutes including
a forty-five (45) minute meal period. The first fifteen (15) minutes of the scheduled day

1.1 Schedules.
There shall be two (2) operating schedules within the Police Department.

a. A "five and two" (5 & 2) schedule with Saturday, Sunday, and Holidays off:

Sunday, and Holidays off may be permitted to switch days off as long as
such switch is accomplished with the mutual consent of the Chief of Police
or his designee and the affected Employee.

b. A "four and two" (4 & 2) schedule which begins the first of each year. The
work year will be divided into thirteen (13) periods of four (4) consecutive
weeks constituting twenty-eight (28) calendar days. During each twenty-
eight (28) day period Employees will be scheduled to work four (4)
consecutive days of eight (8) consecutive hours followed by two (2) off-
duty days. The sequence then repeats itself until the end of the twenty-eight
(28) day period is reached. The 4 & 2 schedule may begin on any day of a
week, however, an Employee will be off sixteen (16) hours between eight
(8)-hour shifts.

1.4

d. Employees may be assigned to either a 5 & 2 or 4 & 2 schedule as
determined by the Chief of Police and in accordance with the needs of the
individual organizational units of the Department.

e. A standing committee, made up of three (3} Employees appointed by the
Association and three (3) members appointed by the Employer, shall be
established. Upon request of either party, this standing committee shall
review the then-current scheduling system utilized by the Employer and, by
mutual agreement, may implement changes in scheduling if agreed to by
the Association and the Employer.

f. Based upon the recommendation of a Supervisor and subject to approval by
the Deputy Chief or Chief, Employees shall be scheduled to work any of
the regular duty shifts. Any schedule changes so instituted shall comply
with the notice provision (Article I], Section 4) of the Agreement and
workday trades may not be used to adjust any schedule assigned through
this process.

Shift Hours.

conducted at least once each year. For purpose of setting base line hours of normal
shifts, the normal shift hours shall be:

Shift I 2245 to 0700 hrs.

Hours."

Training Days.

Certain days during the year shall be designated as Training Days on the 4 & 2
schedule, which shall include the training days mandated by State Law. There shall

b. During change of standard time/daylight savings time.
c, At year change of schedule.

1.6 Special Units.

training. Any Employee who volunteers for such a unit realizes that certain
Agreement provisions may not be met and these Employees may agree to give up
the following, if necessary to meet the goals of the unit: two week schedule change
notice, time off between shifts, and 48 hours off for Pass Days.

Overtime.

Hours worked in excess of the normal work day or normal work week shall be paid at one
and one-half (1 #2) times the Employee's normal hourly-rate as shown in Appendix A. There
shall be no duplication or pyramiding of overtime payments. Employees will not be
required to take time off a regular shift in order to avoid overtime payments.

Overtime for more than eight (8) consecutive hours of work will not be paid during periods
of major schedule changes: that is, year end and daylight savings time.

Minimum Call Out.
Employees called to duty at time other than their normal work schedule, with the exception
of hours adjacent to their normal work shift, shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours at

one and one-half (12) times the Employee's normal hourly rate.

If such duty exceeds the four (4) hour minimum, all hours in excess of the initial four hours
shall be paid at one and one-half (112) times the Employee's normal hourly rate.
4. Work Schedules.

The Employer shall prepare work schedules and post such schedules at least two (2) weeks
prior to their effective date. Employees shall receive two (2) consecutive days off during
each seven (7) day work period. With the mutual consent of the Employee and the
Employer, Employees are exempt from this provision.

The posting requirement shall not apply in instances when an officer requests leave, other
than sick leave, with less than two (2) weeks of advance notice. In such instances, the
Municipality may either change shifts for remaining Employees with less than two (2)
weeks’ notice or it may deny the officer’s request for leave.

5. Court Time.
When an Employee is required to appear in Court, he shall be compensated as follows:

a. If the time in Court falls during his regularly scheduled shift, the Employee will
receive his normal hourly rate for the first eight (8) hours and additional
compensation of one and one-half (1/2) times the Employee's normal hourly rate
for all hours in excess of eight (8).

b. If the time in Court falls during a non-scheduled shift, the Employee will be
compensated at one and one-half (114) times the Employee's normal hourly rate for
all hours in Court with a minimum of four (4) hours.

Local hearings or Magisterial District Judge hearings during a nonscheduled shift
will be compensated at one and one-half (11%) times the Employee's normal hourly
rate with a minimum of three (3) hours.

When a local hearing is scheduled immediately following an Employee's normally
scheduled shift (i.e. 0700 or 1500 hrs.) the Employee will receive overtime pay on
an hour-for-hour basis only.

If an officer has two court appearances scheduled on the same day, the court time
minimum will be paid for the second court appearance only if there is a minimum
of two (2) hours between the end of the first court appearance and the beginning of
the second court appearance.

If available, a police vehicle will be provided for Employees attending juvenile
court. If a vehicle is not available, the Employee will be compensated at the
municipal mileage rate for use of his personal vehicle.

6. Workday Trades.

Employees may elect to trade working days with other Employees of equal rank.
Employees will submit their requests to trade working days via the Department’s
automated scheduling software system as far in advance as possible, but not less than 24
hours prior to the shift change except in exceptional circumstances. All work trades in
excess of four (4) consecutive work days must have the approval of the Watch
Commanders in charge of the affected shifts. Watch Commanders wishing to trade work-
days in excess of four (4) consecutive work days must have approval of the Deputy Chief
of Police. The Employee accepting responsibility for a shift on a work-day trade shall be
held responsible for attendance on that shift, and be charged with any sick time or other
time taken off.

Workday trades will not be permitted for officers whose evaluations by their superiors
indicate they have not met all standards of performance (as evidenced by evaluation) or for
officers who are in remedial training or on probation without approval of the Chief or
Deputy Chief.

Schedules, Shifts and Assignments of New Police Officers.
For the first twenty-four (24) months of a full time officer's employment, the Municipality

shall determine all schedules, shifts and assignments at its sole discretion. This provision
will not be used to discipline officers.

ARTICLE Il - SCHEDULING OF OVERTIME

1,

Emergency Overtime.

Overtime required to relieve an immediate hazard which endangers, or is probably to
endanger, life or property shall be considered “Emergency Overtime" and shall be assigned
by the Supervisor needing the Employee in the manner which he deems most appropriate
to expedite relief of the situation.

In the event the Chief of Police determines in his discretion that there is a danger to public
safety, the Chief may assign emergency overtime in accordance with this section.

Special Services Overtime.

Special Services Overtime is overtime required for events funded by agencies other than
the Employer. The Employer shall have the unfettered prerogative to accept, deny, assign
or modify Special Services Overtime. These tasks will be assigned in conformance with
the Extra Board List (Section 6.) outlined in this Article. Special Services Overtime shall
be set at a flat rate of pay that includes retirement percentage, social security and worker's
compensation. The flat rate need not be at the regular overtime rate but must be agreed
upon by the Association.
Special Police Functions.

Those events which, when designated by the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, require
added police effort for patrol, detective, or other police functions shall be assigned only as
directed by the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee.

Pre-Scheduled Overtime.

Whenever, through extended illness or special police activities, overtime becomes
available in blocks of five (5) or more days, it shall be considered "Pre-Scheduled
Overtime’. When Pre-Scheduled Overtime is available, such overtime will be posted
within the Department's automated scheduling software system indicating the number of
days available and the dates. The overtime will be available for a sign-up period during
which each officer may choose one (1) day to work, beginning with the next available
officer on the Extra Board List. If all have chosen one (1) day and additional days are
available, the process shall begin again. If within seventy-two (72) hours of the beginning
of the overtime block the list is not complete, empty slots will be filled in conformance
with Section 6.

Non-Emergency Overtime.

Any overtime not considered emergency, special services, pre-scheduled or special police
overtime shall be assigned in accordance with the rules and regulations governing the Extra
Board List. Employees on duty continuing an investigation or assignment into overtime
hours are not affected by these rules.

Extra Board List.

The Extra Board List shall contain a chart of all Employees desiring overtime work, and
the amount of time worked by them or charged to them by turning down overtime. The
Extra Board List shall be maintained by the Association for a period of one (1) year, and a
new list shall be started on January 1st of each year. The Department's automated
scheduling software system will be used to create a call list and will notify eligible
Employees of the available overtime: 1) according to least amount of time charged, 2)
according to seniority of Employees charged with equal time. An Employee accepting
overtime shall have this time charged to him on the Extra Board List. Employees attending
court, working during time needed (police work), unable to be contacted, sick, on
emergency leave, holiday, on a shift trade, compensatory time off, on vacation, or having
worked maximum permitted time (16 consecutive hours), shall not have time charged to
the Extra Board List. A Supervisor with less than one and one-half (14) hour notice may
offer overtime to on-duty Employees in accordance with their positions on the Extra Board
List as follows:

a. Go to on-duty shift,

b. By seniority according to the overtime list.
1} Selecting the man with the least amount of overtime, according to the list.

2) If two or more men have the same amount of overtime, the detail will be
given to the senior man.

c. All time will be recorded in the Department automated scheduling software system,
accordingly.
d. If no one accepts the detail, the junior man will be ordered to work no more than

four (4) hours on that detail.

Should a Supervisor be unable to obtain an overtime Employee, he may require a junior
Employee to work until a replacement Employee can be obtained. Except during
emergencies or as determined by the Chief of Police, no Employee may work more than
16 hours in any 24 hour period. Except during emergencies, Employees shall have eight
(8) consecutive hours off time before being required to return after working twelve (12)
hours or permitted to return after working sixteen (16) hours.

An Employee not desiring non-emergency overtime shall notify his Supervisor and his
name will be removed from the Extra Board List. An Employee desiring to be returned to
the Extra Board List shali notify his Supervisor and his name shall be retumed in order of
seniority with time charged equal to maximum charged to any other Employee at time of

Retirement Life.

Upon retirement, all Employees with at least fifteen (15) years of service shall be covered
by retirement term life insurance in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00).

Retirement Medical.

a, Upon retirement, a retiree may elect to either stay in the medical group of the
Employer or may leave the group to purchase his own medical coverage.

Eligible retirees who do not elect to continue coverage at the time of retirement or
who discontinue coverage will not be permitted to elect coverage later.

24
Whether an Employee remains in the group or leaves the group he shall be provided
reimbursement for the cost of retirement medical coverage by the Employer. For
purposes of this section, “the cost of retirement medical coverage” shall be
understood to mean health insurance premium cost only. The maximum amount of
the reimbursement shall be based on the annual base pay for Police Officer VI as
follows:

Years of completed

service at retirement Rate of reimbursement
Less than 15 0

15-19 50% (.0050)
20-24 65% (.0065)
25 and greater 80% (.0080)

Any active Employee retiring after November 21, 2007 shall be eligible for a
retirement medical benefit only until such time as he/she becomes eligible for
Medicare. At that time eligibility for the retirement medical benefit ceases. (This
clarification does not apply to any Employee who retired before the date of this
Award. This clarification is without practice or precedent, and cannot be used by
either party in any litigation affecting an individual(s) who retired before November
21, 2007.)

An Employee shall be permitted to cash in accumulated sick leave upon retirement
and shall elect to use said compensation to assist in the payment of post-retirement
medical benefits or take the full amount of money in cash, with no further obligation
of the Employer to pay for medical benefits. The compensation for cashing in of
accumulated sick leave, which is non-interest bearing, shall be fifteen percent
(15%) of base daily salary for days | through 40; twenty-five percent (25%) of base
daily salary for days 41 through 80; and fifty percent (50%) of base daily salary for
days 81 through 120.

It is specifically understood that it is at the Employee's discretion, on an annual
basis, to determine how much money of the fund would be used on a monthly basis
to further supplement payments by the Employer for medical costs. The election to
take a cash distribution shall not be used in the calculation of pension benefits.

25
13.

d. Upon an Employee's death, the surviving spouse or minor children may utilize the
remaining money in the fund, if any, to assist with the payment for medical benefits
provided under COBRA until the fund is exhausted or the COBRA entitlement
period ends.

€. Any monies remaining in the Employees fund not utilized for medical benefits by
the Employee, or beneficiary, remain with the Employer.

f. The spouse or dependent children of a deceased Employee whose death is directly
related to an incident on active duty shall have full health insurance continued for
a period of two (2) years.

g. All Employees hired on or after May 15, 2012, shall not be eligible for the
Retirement Medical Benefits described in this Article VII, Section 12.

Retirement Plan.

a. Employees shall be covered by the provisions of the Mt. Lebanon Police Retirement
Plan. The plan shall be amended, as of the effective date of this Agreement (January
11, 2004), to provide that all Employees hired after the effective date of this
Agreement (January 11, 2004) shall be provided benefits under a plan in
compliance with Act 600 of the Commonwealth, as amended by Act 30 of 2002.
All existing Employees shall continue to receive the benefits as set forth in the Mt.
Lebanon Police Officers Pension Plan as restated January 1, 2000, as amended.

In addition, the provision in the plan (section 4.09) relating to the payment of a Cost
of Living Adjustment shall be amended as of the effective date of this Agreement
(January 11, 2004) to provide an adjustment of two percent (2%) of the pension
benefit for Employees retiring with less than 20 years of service to the Municipality.
This adjustment remains subject to all other provisions of the section.

b. It is anticipated that Employee contributions will be required, from time to time, to
support the improvements made to the pension plan. In the event that the pension
plan shall require contributions, according to the Minimum Municipal Obligation,
to remain actuarially sound, it is agreed that Employee contributions to a maximum
of four percent (4%) shall be instituted before the Employer would have to make
contributions to the police pension plan from its general revenues, Effective 1/1/17,
such Employee contributions may be increased pursuant to this Section to a
maximum of four and one-half percent (4.5%). It is also agreed that before such
contributions are required of the Employees, the Employer must allocate the Act
205 monies coming into the Municipality form the Commonwealth, because it has
a police department, to the police pension plan. Except in these circumstances, the
Employer remains free to allocate its Act 205 monies pursuant to the authority and
requirements of Act 205. When applicable, the Employer shall provide each
Employee with an annual statement of accumulated contributions to the Plan.

26
14,

c. Effective with the effective date of this Agreement, the Plan will be amended to
include a disability pension in accordance with Act 30 of 2002. The disability
pension shall be in the amount of 50% of salary or the accrued pension benefit at
the time the disability occurs, whichever is higher. There shall be a 100% social
security disability offset to the disability pension, in accordance with the Act.

d. The Employer agrees that no ordinance or resolution affecting the provisions of the
police pension plan shall be adopted by the Board of Commissioners without prior
notification to the UPS.

e. Any Killed in Service Benefit owed to an Employee will be administered and
distributed in accordance with the provisions of Act 51 of 2009, which repealed the
Act 600 of 1956 Killed-In-Service Benefit and converted the benefit to a State
obligation.

Determination of Benefit Eligibility.
Eligibility for receipt of any of the benefits provided in this Article, including Long Term

Disability benefits, shall be as determined solely by the respective Insurer or Administrator
under the provisions of the applicable insurance, pension, or benefit plan.

decision last made and shall not be eligible for further discussion or appeal.

ARTICLE X —- INFRACTIONS

An alleged breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be administered in the manner
set forth in Article IX. The procedures established in Section 2 of Article IX will provide the only
means through which an infringement of any provision of this Agreement is to be determined.

29
When it is determined that an alleged breach of any provision of this Agreement is in fact a
violation caused by the Employer or an Employee(s), the matter shall be settled by monetary
means. If itis determined that the Employer has exercised a breach of this Agreement the Employer
will pay a penalty to the Association. The penalty for a breach of a provision (section) of this
Agreement is fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first occurrence (breach) of the provision, one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for the second occurrence (breach) of the provision, and two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) for the third and subsequent occurrence (breach) of the provision. A second breach of
the provision in question cannot take place until the Employer has become aware of and has had
the opportunity to rectify, the first breach of such provision. In the event it is determined that the
Employer has violated a second of this Agreement and, being cognizant of the breach, continues
the violation in a wanton manner, such breach shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation
continues from the time of its determination as provided above until the time it is corrected.
Further, the Employer will not be liable for any breach when all reasonable means to preserve and
uphold the affected provision(s) of this Agreement have been made. No penalty shall be paid until
it has been acknowledged by the Manager or his authorized representative. It is agreed that the
Employer and Employees will attempt to correct infringements of this Agreement before they
occur. The Employer shall have and retain, solely and exclusively, the right to discipline
Employees for proper cause and nothing in this Article shall prevent the Employer from
establishing the enforcing of reasonable rules for the maintenance of discipline. The Employer
shall have the right to discipline an Employee(s) for proper cause, including suspension, to the
extent that such discipline will be sufficient to make up the Employer's cost as provided under the
provision of this Article. The right to discipline for proper cause makes reference to Article I,
Section 4 and 5.
