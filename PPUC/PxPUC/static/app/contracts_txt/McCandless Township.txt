The Town shall not be responsible for any expense for certifications necessary for any off-duty work, security or any other type. 

(b) 
Itis the intent ofthe parties that Police Patrol Officers should be free to engage in outside employment as specified in the aforementioned paragraph, so long as such employment does not impair the effectiveness of a Police Patrol Officer's on-duty job performance or reflect dishonor on the Town or the Police Department. The Police Patrol Officer will not use any Department equipment for the performance of such off-duty work except work arranged by the Town in the form of extra work details.

The Police Patrol Officer shall reimburse the Town for compensation received for jurydutyexcept for reimbursement for mileage which the employee shall retain. 
When an employee receives notice that he is to report for juryduty, he shall notify his/hersupervisor on his next regularly scheduled work day. 
Health Insurance 
A. Continuation ofBenefits 
1. The Town shall change the current PPO 10 health plan to the PPO 500 plan as soon as practicable in the 2019 calendar year. The Town shall reimburse officers for the expenses incurred under the applicable $500/$1000 deductible each year. The Town shall maintain the PPO 500 plan throughout the term of this Memorandum of Understanding, but may change health insurance carriers as long as: 
a.  The Town meets with the MPOA prior to plan implementation,  
and  
b.  The new plan contains at least a similar level of coverages,  

benefits, and plan network as the existing plan. 
2. 
The applicable cost ofhospital/surgical/major medical insurance will be borne by the Town while Police Patrol Officer is on the Town's payroll and for a two (2) year period after Police Patrol Officer is no longer receiving sick leave pay from the Town and does not have similar health insurance available from another source. 

3. 
To the extent that such payments are accepted by the carrier therefor, affected bargaining unit Police Patrol Officers will be offered an opportunity to reimburse the Town for hospital/surgical/major medical insurance premium payments due after this two (2) year period under these provisions. 

4. 
The Town will pay an amount equivalent to two (2) months current premium, based on the level of coverage declined, at the end of each year to each Police Patrol Officer who declines coverage from said hospitalization/surgical/major medical program and contributions will not be deducted from wages during that year. In the event a Police Patrol Officer returns to the Town's medical program, this amount will be prorated 


in accordance with the number of months there was no coverage. Subject to insurance provided regulations, the Police Patrol Officer may re-enter the Town medical program at anytime. In the event a Police Patrol Officer discontinues his employment, this amount will be prorated in accordance with the number of months there was no coverage and will be paid with the last paycheck the officer is entitled to receive. 
5. Each Police Patrol Officer covered under the Town's health insurance plan shall contribute toward the cost of the plan as follows: 7.0% of premium beginning on January 1, 2019. The existing $150 per month cap on such contributions shall be eliminated. 
B. Affordable Care Act 
At the time of execution of this Agreement, considerable uncertainty concerning the details and effect of the Federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) exists. Particularly, the federal agencies with jurisdiction have yet to issue final regulations concerning many of the provisions and terms ofthe ACA. For example, a notice requirement concerning ACA's health insurance exchanges has been delayed, and regulations which will define those ACA health insurance exchanges have not yetbeen issued. In orderto overcome this uncertainty, the parties have negotiated this Agreement based upon the mutual belief and premise that the health care plan and benefits being provided to the Police Officers under this Agreement will be in compliance with any requirements of the ACA concerning essential health benefits and will not constitute a "Cadillac plan" for purposes of requiring the Town to pay a 40% excise tax, and will not have adverse economic consequences to the parties which are not currently known. In the event that either the Town ofMcCandless or the Police Officers suffer a material negative economic impact as a result of the ACA, or any regulations promulgated by the federal agencies with jurisdiction thereunder, or any action taken or not taken by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a result of its concurrent authority or jurisdiction under the ACA, then the parties agree to negotiate over possible amendments to this Agreement to address said material negative economic consequences in accordance with Act 111 of 1968, including interest arbitration if necessary. The scope of any such negotiations or Act 111 arbitration proceedings shall be limited to possible

This benefit will be provided one time only. Ifafter attending the clinic a Police Patrol Officer continues to smoke, he/she will be obligated to reimburse the Town for the cost ofthe stop 
smoking clinic. 
Bargaining unit employees will be provided basic life insurance coverage, plus double indemnity for accidental death, in each calendar year ofthis Agreement, as follows: 100% ofbase salary, rounded to the next highest $5000.
