The Salary Continuance plan does not apply in cases ofwork related injuries wherein the officer is covered by the terms and provisions ofthe Pennsylvania Heart and Lung Act, Workers' Compensation Act and/or the disability pension provisions ofthe police pension plan. 
The amount ofSalary Continuance payments is determined by the officer's salary* in effect on the date the disability begins and the officer's service as ofthat date. Payments shall be made according to the following 
schedule: 
Years of Full Two-Thirds Continuous Service Salary (2/3 Salary) 
Up to 1 Year 2 Weeks 2 Weeks 1 to 3 Years 1 Month** 5 Months 3 to 5 Years 2 Months 4 Months 5 to 10 Years 3 Months 3 Months 1 0 to 15 Years 4 Months 2 Months 15 to 20 Years 5 Months 1 Month 20 Years & Over 6 Months 0 Months 
* Salary -The Officer' s current base salary. ** Month -Two (2) bi-weekly pay periods. 
In all cases, benefits terminate the month following the officer's 70th 
birthday, or the month preceding the officer's retirement date, if sooner.

officer is disabled, beginning with the first scheduled work day.

Ifthe officer becomes disabled from unrelated causes after having received Salary Continuance payments, his subsequent absence will be considered the same period ofdisability unless separated by a return to work.

Officers may elect to take any vacation to which they are entitled in lieu of receiving Salary Continuation payments. This has the effect ofextending the period the officer receives full salary, but in no case will the combined duration ofvacation and Salary Continuance exceed six (6) months. In addition, vacation in lieu ofSalary Continuance will not affect the requirement that an officer be disabled for the required period prior to receiving Long Term Disability benefits, provided that other plan 
provisions are satisfied.
