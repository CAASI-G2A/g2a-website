C. 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. -night time; and 
D. Other shifts will be any shift other than those enumerated above as posted by the Mayor 
E. The implementation of these shift times shall not result in ove11ime. 
F. The Chief ofPolice will have the ability to alter the starting and ending times ofshifts by sixty (60) minutes at the start ofeach four month scheduling period referenced in Article V, Section 3(E). The Chief shall also retain the ability to create non-standard shifts for specialty assignments with starting and ending times up to one hundred and twenty (120) minutes before or after the standard shifts. 
2. Calendar week and calendar days shall be defined as follows: 
A. Calendar week shall nm from 10:00 p.m. Saturday to 10:00 p.m. the following Saturday prevailing time. 
B. Calendar days shall run from I0:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. the following day and this day will be deemed to be the day in which the time period ends. 
C. If a shift other than those enumerated above now exist or is established in the future, assignment will be made to one ofthe three enumerated shifts based on the time allocation ofthe majority ofhours ofthe other shift within the three daily work shifts. For example, a 
shift established from 8:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. will be identified as part of the night time shift, since six (6) ofthe hours worked on that shift fall within the 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. time block. If another shift was to be created so that the hours worked were split evenly between two established shifts, assignment to a shift ,vill be at the discretion of the Mayor/ChiefofPolice/Management. 
3. l11e Borough shall post a work schedule for a one (1) year period, prepared by the Mayor or his'11er designee which shall encompass the following:

B. The parties recognize that circumstances may ;equire that a previously posted schedule may have to be changed. For non-floating employees, ifa change is to be made it must be done so forty-eight ( 48) hours in advance, except in the case ofan emergency, and will be signed, dated and timed by the Mayor or his/her designee and countersigned by the Officer in Charge ofthe shift working at the time. The Chiefshall not change an officer's schedule for the sole purpose of avoiding overtime caused by subpoenas for court appearances for one (I) day. The Borough will designate the two (2) least senior officers in the Department as "Floaters." Floaters will not bid on shifts, but may be scheduled at the discretion ofthe Borough. Schedules ofFloaters may be changed by the Borough with five (5) days' notice. Dming a standard work week Floaters will typically work five (5) shifts with two (2) consecutive days off and will have al least sixteen (16) consecutive hours offbetween shifts. Floaters may be scheduled to fill schedule vacancies, including. but not limited to, those caused by officers using paid or unpaid leave.

For example, Sergeants, other than the Administrative Sergeant, will bid for placement on the Sergeant schedule based on date ofpromotion to Sergeant and Patrol Officers will bid for placement on the Patrol Officer schedule based on a seniority basis determined by date ofhire. The designated Floaters will not participate in schedule bidding. Within a given calendar year, officers may not select the same shift for two (2) four (4) month periods in a row. For example, officers could not select the daylight shift twice in a row within a calendar year. The schedule ofthe Administrative Sergeant will continue to be set by the Chiefof Police based on operational needs ofthe Department. 
F. The Chief may schedule specialty assignment employees, such as detective, administrative personnel, background investigators, etc., to shift hours other than the standard patrol shift hours to meet the operational needs of the Police Department.

\
time seniority will be used to begin the process again. 
3. 
When an occasion arises requiring an officer to be called for overtime, the officer \Vith the least amount of accumulated overtime shall be called first, second least of accumulated overtime second, and so on. In the event that two (2) or more ofticers have equal accumulated overtime, seniority will prevail.

The Borough may at its discretion offer to the Police Officers compensatory time off in lieu ofpay for said training time. The Borough shall state the amount ofcompensatory time being offered for any such training pro1:,>Tam in advance of the training. The Chief of Police may develop a policy to implement this section to encourage training through awarding of compensatory time. Compensatory time under this policy shall be awarded on an hour-for-hour basis. Compensatory time awarded for voluntary training shall not be treated in the same way as compensatory time awarded in lieu of statutory overtime pay and appropriate separate records shall be maintained.

7. Consistent with longstanding practice, situations involving an emergency will not require the use of the overtime assignment procedure. Such emergencies shall include, but shall not be limited to, overtime required to r~eve an immediate and current hazard which endangers or may endanger life or prope1ty. Such "Emergency Overtime" shall be assigned by the Supervisor/OlC in the manner which he or she deems most appropriate to expedite relief ofthe situation. In the event the Chief ofPolice detem1ines there is an immediate and current hazard which endangers or may endanger life or property, the Chief may assign emergency overtime in accordance with this section. If time and manpower allow the Borough shall utilize the overtime roster. 
Article No. VIII -Officer-In-Charge Pay
