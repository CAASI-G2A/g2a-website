Saleh, 
I am trying to register you for the Leadership Program for First Line Supervisors class, but it is requiring questions that I can't answer. As soon as possible, can you please come to my office and fill this out so we can get you registered. I won't be able to go forward without certain information that they are requiring. Sorry for the inconvenience. 
Thanks
