B. Police pension benefits will be calculated upon the officer's total W-2 earnings (50% of average oflast 36 months ofemployment); provided however, any lump sum payments received upon retirement shall not be included in the calculation of monthly pension benefits, except to the extent that said payments are for benefits which were earned during the calculation period, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Auditor General Bulletin No. 2001-01, as amended. This provision will remain in effect so long as the Township does not receive an adverse audit finding or recommendation from the Pennsylvania Auditor General's Office concerning the method of calculating police officer pension benefits. If the Township receives such an audit finding or recommendation, then the provisions ofthis paragraph will be reopened for negotiations in accordance with Act 111 of 1968. All outstanding grievances and unfair labor practice charges regarding pension issues are settled by the above and will be withdrawn. 
C. The Township agrees to implement a DROP Pension Provision in Accordance with Exhibit "C" and Attachment 1 (Memo dated March 27, 2006) which are attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

{DocNo=00415468.l} 
G. Pension Contributions will be calculated in accordance with this paragraph. 
During each year of this agreement, the Tovmship agrees to have a calculation performed to determine the necessary minimum municipal obligation for the succeeding year as required by Act 205. In the event that the calculation determines that a contribution is necessary to be made by the Police Department, then, the contribution shall be deducted from the total wages of the police department, but not to exceed eight percent (8%) of the total wages of the officers, and provided further that the amount of state aid under Act 205, payable to the Township, representing units for uniformed personnel, shall have been included in the calculation. In the event that the calculation determines that no contribution or a contribution of less than five percent (5%) is required, then the Township shall likewise require an actuarial study to be I made to authorize a reduction in the amount of the contribution to be made by the 
I 
Police Department for each succeeding year, but no less, of course, than zero percent (0%). In addition, when the actuarial study is commissioned by the Township to determine the actuarial soundness of the plan with respect to Police contributions to 
the Pension Fund, the Police may also inquire of the actuary to determine what, if any, additional benefits are available to the Police Officers of the Township, Under Act 600 and any amendment thereto, and such additional benefits as may be actuarially feasible, as determined by the plan's actuary, shall be implemented by the Township and such benefits shall be provided to the Police, In the event that additional legislation shall be enacted authorizing additional benefits to Police Officers from the Police Pension Plan, and such benefits are authorized by statute without actuarial study, the Township shall provide such benefits to the Police; in the event an actuarial study is required, the Township agrees to direct an actuarial study be conducted to determine the feasibility of payment of such new benefits. In addition, if case law, as determined by the highest appellate court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall determine that benefits are available to the Police Officers of the Township which benefits are not presently available as construed under Act 600, and such benefits are actuarially feasible, as determined by the plan's actuary, then the Township shall implement such benefits and provide them to the police, In the event that a difference in opinion shall exist between the Police and the Township regarding the interpretation of such judicial decisions, or of any statutes, which may be enacted as indicated hereto, then the decision shall be referred to the Township. Any disagreement relating to the interpretation may be referred to an arbitrator by following the grievance procedure set out in this Agreement. The cost of actuarial studies and other expenses associated with the study ( costs, etc.) but excluding legal fees, and fees of any actuary not employed by the Tovmship shall be paid from the Pension Plan. 
For the purpose stated herein, actuarial studies shall be conducted by the actuary employed by the Township. The term, "actuarially sound" or "actuarially feasible" shall be given the same meaning and interpretation as has been in effect in the past as those terms are historically and customarily determined by the plan actuary and shall have the customary meaning applied by actuaries for these purposes. Nothing contained herein shall be construed so as to require contributions to the pension plan by the Township from General or other funds, except the funds allocated to the plan under Act 205 and which shall be allocated by the Tovmship in accordance with the 
{DocNo~0041546B.l) 
provisions of Act 205, subject to the foregoing provisions. If contributions should be

The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had the member elected to cease employment and receive a normal retirement benefit shall, upon the Member commencing participation in the DROP program, be credited on the first day of each month into a separate ledger account established by the Plan Administrator to track and accumulate the Participant's monthly pension benefits. This account shall be designated the DROP accatuit. The DROP Account shall not contain a guaranteed interest rate. The account shall be managed by the Plan Administrator pursuant to the same fiduciary obligations and principles applicable to management of the municipal pension plans. The Plan Administrator may allow Participants to select certain types of investments from an available list of choices. Frequency of investment changes will be at the discretion of the Plan Administrator. All earnings credited to the DROP account will be included in the final cash settlement. · 
F. Early Termination. A Participant may withdraw from the DROP program at any time and effectuate a complete retirement from service. No penalty shall be imposed for early termination of DROP participation. However, the Participant shall not be permitted to make any withdrawals from the DROP Account until DROP participation has ended. During the last year of DROP participation, if a DROP Participant becomes disabled for a period in excess of 60 consecutive days, regardless of whether the disability is service related, he/she shall be deemed to have applied for early termination of DROP participation and will then terminate employment with the Township and receive his/her normal retirement benefits. 
G. Payout. Upon the termination date set forth in the DROP Election Form or on such date as the Participant withdraws or is terminated from the DROP program, if earlier, the normal retirement benefits payable to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, if applicable, shall be paid directly to the Participant or beneficiary and shall no longer be credited to the DROP Account. Within thirty (30) days following actual termination of a Participant's employment with Collier Township, the accumulated balance in the DROP Account shall be paid to the Participant in a single lump-sum payment. Such payment shall be made either in cash, subject to any federal withholding as may be required, or as a direct rollover to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). If the Participant selects the rollover option, he or she must also submit the appropriate paperwork from the IRA custodian within twenty (20) days following termination. 
H Death. If a Participant dies before the DROP Account balance is paid, the Participant's beneficiary under Act 600 shall have the same rights as the Participant to withdraw the DROP Account balance. The monthly benefit credited to the Participant's DROP Account during the month of the Participant's death shall be the final monthly benefit for DROP 
{DocNa=00415468.l l 
participation. 
I. Killed-In-Service Survivor Benejit. If a Participant is killed in service, the Participant's beneficiaries under Act 600 shall be entitled to apply for and receive a recalculation for payment of survivor benefits at 100% of the Participant's salary as fixed at the date of retirement. 
J. A DROP Participant is not eligible for promotion to Sergeant. 
K. Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP Ordinance shall be consistent with the provisions covering deferred retirement option plans set forth in any applicable collective bargaining agreement or state or federal law, and shall be binding upon all fnture participants and upon all Participants who have balances in their DROP Accounts. 
Section 3: Effective Date 
The effective date of the DROP program will be January 1, 2006. 
Section 4: Severability 
The provisions ofthis Ordinance shall be severable, and if any of its provisions shall be held to 
be unconstitutional or illegal, the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this Ordinance 
shall not be affected thereby. It is hereby expressly declared as the intent of Collier Township that this Ordinance has been adopted as if such unconstitutional or illegal provision or provisions 
had not been included herein. 
Section 5: Pending Legislation 
In the event of the passage of legislation governing DROPs in the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, this Ordinance shall be amended to comply with any new legal requirements set fotth in such legislation. The application of any amendments to police officers actively employed 
as of the effective date of any such legislation shall be governed by and consistent with 
constitutional principles applicable to the pension and retirement benefits.

Exhibit "D" "Weapons Purchi!se Program" 
1. 
Collier Township Police Officers will submit their order for one weapon (Duty, Back-Up, Off-Duty, Rifle or Shotgun) that they are purchasing. Collier Township will pay the bill and deduct the cost of the weapon from the Officer's pay over the course of eighteen (18) months or thirty-nine (39) pay periods. The Officer will also have the ability to pay off the balance at any time during the 18 month deduction period. The payroll clerk would handle all of the necessary payroll deductions. 

2. 
Officers will not be permitted to purchase any weapon that they are unable to pay back within the 18 month timeframe. Also, any officer who leaves the employment of the Tovmship will have the entire outstanding balance owed on the weapon deducted from their last paycheck, or will be required to remit the entire outstanding balance to the Township. In the event the entire balance is not paid, the weapon will become the property of Collier Township and any transfer paperwork costs will be the responsibility 


I of the officer. 
I 
3. An officer will be required to qualify with the weapon within twelve (12)months of receiving the weapon from the seller. Failure to qualify with the weapon will result in a default on the program and the officer will become responsible for the remaining
