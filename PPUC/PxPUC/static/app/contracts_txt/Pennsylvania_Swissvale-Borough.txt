Eye and Dental. The existing benefit through Municipal Benefit Services

(MBS) shall be continued in the new Agreement.
2.

Contribution Toward Hospitalization Premium.

Each officer who is

covered by health insurance shall contribute ten percent ( 10%) of the monthly premium for his
or her hospitalization up to a maximum of $100.00 per month. Residents of the Borough, i.e.,
officers who maintain their primary, permanent domicile in Swissvale Borough, shall contribute
five percent (5%) of the monthly premium, up to a maximum of $50.00 a month. This provision
shall apply to all employees who have hospitalization coverage.
3.

Hospitalization Reopener,

In the event that premiums for any level of

coverage exceed 15% in any one year over the premium for the previous year, the Borough
may reopen the contract for purposes of negotiating an alternative hospitalization plan. Each
officer shall cooperate in filling out medical questionnaires or providing any necessary medical
or other information to enable the Borough to obtain alternative medical insurance proposals.
The amount of premium contribution shall not be subject to the reopener.
Section B.

Hospitalization for Retirees. The hospitalization plan provided to active

full time bargain unit members shall be extended to retirees, husband and wife only, until age
65. It is understood, however, that the costs for providing hospitalization for those retiring this
contract year will be subtracted from the amount negotiated for the next contract and each year
thereafter for as long as this benefit exists. Provided also, however, the costs will be subtracted
from the police wages up to a maximum of $300 per man. The Borough will pay costs that
exceed $300.

The cost of hospitalization as previously mentioned shall be determined by

taking the actual number of members of the police unit plus the chief and dividing that into the
total costs of the hospitalization for retirees.
Section C.

Disability Insurance. Individuals who receive a full disability retirement in

accordance with state law and Borough ordinances shall be entitled to the hospitalization

9

..'
'

benefit set forth above on prorated basis. The proration shall be based on the assumption that
the regular benefit for regular retirees is a maximum of ten ( 10) years of benefits, and that the
required number of years of service for regular retirement is twenty-five (25) years. Therefore,
an individual who receives a disability pension and who has fifteen (15) years of service would
receive 15/25 or 3/5 of the ten (10) year benefit or, in other words, six (6) years of
hospitalization benefits. Similarly, an individual who has twenty (20) years of service at the time
that he becomes eligible for a disability pension would receive 20/25 or 4/5 of the benefit or, in
other words, eight (8) years of benefits. The benefit would be for husband and wife coverage
as it is for regular retirees.

ARTICLE XI Sick Leave and Personal Days

Section A.

Each full-time police officer shall be entitled to ten (10) sick days per year

cumulative to 120 days. Accumulated sick days up to 90 days may be exchanged for
compensatory time only at the time of an employee's retirement.
Section B.

A doctor's excuse will not be required when a police officer has missed 3

days or less because of illness, unless there is reason to believe that the illness provision is
being abused.
Section C.

Each full-time police officer shall be entitled to two (2) personal days

which can be used on 48 hours notice. If the days are not used they can be carried over as sick
days at the end of the year. These days may be used without 48 hours notice for emergency
reasons that arise unexpectedly. Notice shall be given to the Chief as soon as possible in
advance of use of an emergency day. The Chief of Police may make reasonable inquiry to
verify the basis for the absence on an emergency day.

10

ARTICLE XII Sick and Accident Insurance
Section A.

After expiration of sick leave and payment up to the number of

accumulated sick leave days, sickness and accident insurance benefits shall be at the rate of
$200 per week for a period of ninety (90) days. The Borough, in its discretion, may obtain sick
and accident insurance to provide this benefit or may pay the amount out of Borough funds.

Section A.

Life insurance coverage will be provided as follows:

$50,000 life

insurance with a double indemnity provision shall be provided for each active police officer.
Section B.

In case of death of an active police officer, his widow or estate, shall be

paid any unpaid longevity pay for the year in which his death occurs and pay for all earned
holidays during that year including any holidays which fall in the pay period in which death
occurs.

ARTICLE XIV Disability Insurance
Section A.

Disability insurance shall begin after ninety (90) days and shall be at the

rate of sixty percent (60%) of the officer's salary, not to exceed $6000 per month. It is
understood that the said disability policy shall not cover a starting patrolman until he has
finished his legal probationary period.

shall be provided by the Borough's

selected

insurance provider.
