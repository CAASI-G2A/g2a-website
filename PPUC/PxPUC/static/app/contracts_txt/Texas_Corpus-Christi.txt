D C. Investigation Guidelines. "Internal Affairs Investigation" means cases where an allegation of misconduct has been made, a complaint has been generated, assigned for follow up investigation; it does not include incidents or situations arising in the field which require initial 
...J fact finding to prepare a complaint. In the event that a police officer is interviewed by a division commander, captain, or internal investigator regarding an internal affairs investigation, which, if

have one representative, an attorney, Association representative or a personal representative, present during the employee's interview, unless the officer in writing voluntarily waives this right.

12. The Chief of Police recognizes the right of Association members to seek advice or representation by designated Association representatives, and to confer with such designated Association representatives and legal counsel.

notice to the Association. 
J E. After the notice and opportunity for rebuttal provided in the preceding paragraph the Chief may demote, suspend, terminate, or take alternative disciplinary action against an employee by personal service on the employee of a written statement of charges. If the ChiefJ should be unable to secure personal service after due diligence, service may be made by placing it in the mail addressed to the employee's last known address along with delivery of the statement to the Association, and proof of such service shall be sufficient to support anyJ disciplinary action. A copy of such statement, along with a copy of the notice of contemplated disciplinary action, shall be promptly filed with the Director ofHuman Resources ofthe City. 
J The written statement shall point out the particular rule or rules alleged to have been violated by the employee and the specific act or acts alleged to be in violation.

Within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the list, the Director of Human Resources shall contact the employee or his/her designee in order for the employee or his/her designee and the City to alternately strike the names on the list, and the remaining name shall be the arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree as to who shall strike first, the parties shall decide by a coin toss. 
J G. The hearing shall be commenced within such reasonable time as the arbitrator selected can be scheduled. If the arbitrator selected cannot commence the hearing within fifty (50) calendar days from his/her selection, either party may, within five (5) calendar days of so J learning, call for selection of a new arbitrator, and if the parties cannot agree upon a substitute within five (5) calendar days ofso learning, another arbitrator shall be selected from a new list of seven (7) names immediately requested from the American Arbitration Association, according to J the procedure set out herein.
