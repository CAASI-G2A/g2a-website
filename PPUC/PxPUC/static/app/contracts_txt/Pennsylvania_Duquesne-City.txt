ALCOHOL & SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY
42.1. PURPOSE

42.1.1. The purpose of this policy is to provide all employees with notice of the provisions of the
Department’s drug-testing program to ensure all employees are fit for duty.

42.2. It is the policy of the DUQUESNE POLICE DEPARTMENT that the critical mission of
public safety justifies the maintenance of a drug free work environment through the use of a
reasonable employee drug-testing program. The Department has a legal responsibility and a
management obligation to make it a condition of employment that all Department employees be
free of drug dependence, illegal drug use of drug abuse, alcohol or other substance abuse.

The law enforcement profession has several uniquely compelling interests that justify the use of
employee drug testing. The public has a right to expect that those who protect them are at all
times both physically and mentally prepared to assume these duties. Both the Municipality and
its employees are exposed to liability if the Municipality falls to ensure that its employees are
able to perform their duties without endangering themselves or the public. Where law
enforcement employees participate in illegal drug use and drug activity, the integrity of the law
enforcement profession, and public confidence in it are destroyed. This confidence is further
eroded by the potential for corruption created by drug use.

The illegal possession and the use of drugs and narcotics is a crime and dearly unacceptable by
Municipal employees. Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the Department and to
preserve public trust and confidence in a fit and drug-free law enforcement profession, the
DUQUESNE Police Department shall implement a drug-~testing program to detect prohibited
drug use by its employees.

42.2.1 DEFINITIONS
A. Employee: Includes all sworn police officers.

B. Probationary Employee: A person who is conditionally employed with the
Department as an employee.

C. Supervisor: Those employees assigned to a position having day-to-day
responsibility for supervising subordinates.

D. Drug-Test: A urinalysis test, consisting of both a drug “screen” test and a
confirmatory test (to be used in the event drug screen test results are positive),
administered under approved, pre-established conditions and procedures for the
purpose of detecting illegal drug use by employees.

E. Reasonable Suspicion: That quantity of proof or evidence that is more than a

hunch, but less than probable cause. Reasonable suspicion must be based on
specific, clear and objective facts and any rationally derived inferences from those

28
facts about the conduct of an individual that would lead a reasonable person to
suspect that the individual is or has been using drugs or alcohol while on or off-
duty.

42.3. RULES OF CONDUCT AND EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES

42.3.1. Prohibited Activity: The following rules apply to all employees while on and off-duty:

to use prescription medicine which they have been informed has the
potential to impair job performance. The employee shall advise the
supervisor of the known side-effects of such medication, and the
prescribed period of use.

2. Supervisors shall document this information through the use of an Internal
memorandum to the Chief of Police. The memorandum shall be retained
in a secure file.

3. The supervisor or Chief of Police may temporarily reassign the employee

a controlled substance shall immediately report the incident to their supervisor so
that appropriate medical steps may be taken to ensure the employee’s health and
safety.

Any employee having a reasonable basis to believe another employee is illegally
using, or in possession of any controlled substance shall immediately report the
facts and circumstances to their supervisor. Failure to do shall subject the
employee to disciplinary action.

Any employee having a reasonable basis to believe another employee is
intoxicated and under the influence of alcohol while on duty, shall immediately
report the facts and circumstances to their supervisor.

42.3.2. Any employee who is aware that he/she is dependent upon alcohol and who voluntarily
admits the same, prior to being ordered to submit to an alcohol test, shall not be disciplined.
Rather, he/she shall be permitted to apply for short-term disability for the purpose of obtaining

24
rehabilitative treatment for his/her dependency. This option, however, shall be afforded to an
employee only once during his/her tenure with the Department for rehabilitative treatment for
alcohol dependency. The Chief of Police shall take into account the facts and circumstances of
the dependency in making any decision to proceed with disciplinary action.

42.3.3 Any employee who is aware that he/she is dependent upon narcotics, whether prescribed
or otherwise, or upon controlled substances or types of drugs and who voluntarily admits the
same prior to being ordered to submit to a drug-test shall be permitted to apply for short term
disability for the purpose of obtaining rehabilitative treatment for his/her dependency. This
option, however, shall be afforded to an employee only once during his/her tenure with the
Department. The Chief of Police shall take into account the facts and circumstances of the
dependency in making any decision to proceed with disciplinary action.

42.3.4 Any employee who fails or refuses to submit to a drug or alcohol test under the terms and
conditions set forth in this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action. Any employee who does
submit to drug or alcohol testing pursuant to the circumstances, terms and conditions of this

2. A confirmed positive drug-test indicating drug use prohibited by this policy.
42.4.2 Probationary Employee Drug-Testing:
A. All probationary employees shall be required as a condition of employment to
participate in any unannounced mandatory drug tests scheduled during their

probationary period. The frequency and timing of such tests shall be determined
by the Chief of Police or his/her designee.

B. In addition, where the probationary employee has a past history of drug use,
he/she shall be required to submit to random testing until the probationary period
is successfully completed. The frequency and timing of such testing shall be
determined by the Chief of Police or his/her designee.

25
42.4.3 OTHER FULL-TIME POLICE OFFICERS

A. Employees will be required to submit to drug or blood alcohol testing as a
condition of continued employment in order to ascertain prohibited activity as
provided below:

1. A supervisor may order an employee to take a drug or alcohol test upon
documented reasonable suspicion that the employee is or has been using
drugs or alcohol. A summary of the facts supporting the order shall be
made available to the employee prior to the actual test.

2. As a condition for appointment/promotion to designated specialized units

SUSPICION

42.5.1. The supervisor, in the Chief’s absence, recommending an employee to submit to a
drug/alcohol test shall prepare a report setting forth the specific facts and reasons which form the
basis for the reasonable suspicion that lead to the order for testing. The report shall be forwarded
to the Chief of Police, Assistant Chief of Police or their designee, who shall maintain it in
confidence pending the test results.

42.5.2. The supervisor recommending the test shall arrange to have the suspected employee
immediately transported to the hospital emergency room and shall arrange for the suspected
employee to be absent from his/her assignment for this purpose in the most discreet manner
possible, and whenever possible, without advising additional personnel of the reason for the
employee’s absence.

42.5.3. No disciplinary action shall be taken against an employee who has been ordered to take
and has taken a drug/alcohol test based on reasonable suspicion during the period between the
time he/she is ordered to take the test and the Department is advised of the test results. During
that period, however, the employee shall be placed on Administrative Leave with pay and shall

26

Such failure or refusal, however, shall be deemed to be a failure or refusal to submit to a duly
authorized drug or blood alcohol test and shall constitute a disobedience to an order, as well as a
violation of this policy, and this shall subject the employee so failing or refusing to disciplinary
action. Any such failure or refusal shall be reported to the Chief of Police or supervisor
authorizing the drug or alcohol test. The Chief of Police or supervisor shall initiate a complaint
against the employee for a violation of this policy and for failure to obey an order from a
superior.

42.6.5. The employee shall indicate on the consent form any prescription or over-the-counter
medication that he/she has taken within four days prior to the date of the testing, and, if so, in

what quantities and at approximately what times. Nothing herein, however, shall in any respect
modify the employee’s responsibilities under Section 42.3.1. B(1) above.

42.6.6. The testing facility area shall be private and secure.
A. Authorized testing personnel shall search the facility before an employee enters it
to produce a urine sample, and document that it is free from any foreign

substances.

B. The employee shall be tested as per the lab procedures.

27
42.6.7. Whenever there is reason to believe the employee may have altered or substituted the
specimen to be provided, a second specimen shall be obtained immediately, under direct
observation of the testing personnel.

42.6.8. Where the employee appears unable, or unwilling to give a specimen at the time of the
test, testing personnel shall document the circumstances on the drug-testing report form. The
employee shall be permitted no more than eight hours to give a sample, during which time he/she
shall remain in the testing area, under observation. Reasonable amounts of water may be given
to the employee to encourage urination. Failure to submit a sample shall be considered a refusal
to submit to a drug-test. If an employee is held past their assigned shift, then that employee will
be compensated for that time spent, at the overtime rate.

42.6.9, Employees shall have the right to request that their urine sample be split and stored in
case of legal disputes. The urine samples must be provided at the same time, and marked and
placed in identical containers by authorized testing personnel. One sample shall be submitted for
immediate drug screening. The other sample shall remain in the custody of the testing facility in
frozen storage. This sample shall be made available to the employee or his/her attorney should
the original sample result in a legal dispute or the chain of custody be broken.

42.6.10. Specimen samples shall be sealed, labeled and checked against the identity of the
employee to ensure the results match the tested specimen. Samples shall be stored in a secured

and refrigerated atmosphere until tested or delivered to the testing laboratory representative.

collected.

42.6.12. In the case of a drug or alcohol test based on reasonable suspicion, the results of the
employees drug screen or alcohol test shall be furnished to the Chief of Police ordering the test
as soon as they are known.

42.613. In the case of a positive test result on the drug screening test, a confirmatory test will be
conducted as expeditiously as possible and the results forwarded to the Chief of Police. The

confirmatory test may be performed by an independent lab, if requested by the employee, at the
employees expense.

42.7. DRUG TESTING METHODOLOGY
42.7.1. The testing or processing phase shall consist of a two-step procedure.
A. Initial screening test, and

B. Confirmation test.

28
42.7.2. The urine sample is first tested using the initial drug screening procedure. An initial
positive test result shall not be considered conclusive, rather, it will be classified as
“confirmation pending.”

42.7.3. A specimen testing positive shall undergo an additional confirmatory test. The
confirmation procedure shall be technologically different and more sensitive then the initial
screening test.

42.7.4. The drug screening tests selected shall be capable of identifying marijuana, cocaine, and
every major drug of abuse including heroin, amphetamines, barbiturates and anabolic steroids.
Personnel utilized for testing shall be certified as qualified to collect urine samples or adequately
trained in collection procedures.

42.7.5. Concentrations of a drug at or above the following levels shall be considered a positive
test result when using the initial immunoassay drug screening test:

Initial Test
Level ng/ml
Marijuana Metabolite 50
Cocaine Metabolite 300
Opiate Metabolites 300*
Phencyclidine 25
Amphetamines 1000

Anabolic Steroids
*25 ng/ml if immunoassay specific for free morphine

42.7.6. Concentrations of a drug at or above the following levels shall be considered a positive
test result when performing a confirmatory GC/MS test on a urine specimen that tested positive
using a technologically different initial screening method:

Marijuana Metabolite 15 (1)
Cocaine Metabolite 150 (2)
Opiates:

Morphine 300
Codeine 300
Phencyclidine 25
Amphetamines:

Amphetamine 500
Methamphetamine 500

Anabolic Steroids
(1) Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9carboxylic acid
(2) Benzoylecgonine

42.7.7. The laboratory selected to conduct the analysis shall be experienced and capable of

quality control, documentation, chain-of-custody, technical expertise and demonstrated
proficiency in urinalysis.

29
42.8. ALCOHOL TESTING

42.8.1. As required by 49 CFR Part 40, the alcohol test is to be conducted by a certified “breath
alcohol technician” (BAT.) using an “evidential breath testing device” (E.B.T.) which is
approved by the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA). Tests are conducted in an
area where confidentiality of results is assured. If the alcohol screening testing indicates an
alcohol concentration 0.02 or greater, a confirmation test must be done 15-20 minutes later.

42.9, COLLECTION SITES

42.9.1. They must follow the guidelines established by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) for collecting, handling, and storing urine drug specimens and must meet the exacting
“chain-of-custody” requirements. Alcohol testing can be done only by a certified Breath Alcohol
Technician (BAT.) using an approved Evident Breath Testing Device (EBT)

42.10. UNOBSERVED SPECIMEN COLLECTION

42.10.1. Individual shall be permitted to provide urine specimens in private and will not be
directly observed. Exceptions to this are rare and are described below.

42.11. OBSERVED SPECIMEN COLLECTION
42.11.1. May occur under the following circumstances

A. When the specimen fall outside the range of 90.5 to 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit or
show signs of contamination;

B. When a previous urine specimen provided by the individual was determined by
the laboratory to have a specific gravity of less than 1.003 and a creatinine
concentration below .2g/1; or

¢. When the collection site person observes conduct dearly indicating an attempt to
substitute or adulterate the sample.

42.12. LABORATORIES TO BE USED

42.12.1. Only laboratories certified by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the
Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS) to conduct Workplace Drug Testing
Programs will be used to analyze urine specimens. The NIDA/DHHS Certification indicates that
the laboratory meets the highest standards for drug testing.

42.13 MEDICAL REVIEW OFFICER (MRO)

42.13.1. The Municipality will utilize a Medical Review Officer to review and interpret test
results obtained through drug testing. The MRO is a physician knowledgeable in the medical use

30
of prescription drugs and the pharmacology and toxicology of illicit drugs. Our Municipality
Medical Review Officer service is provided by a third party administrator.

42.13.2. The MRO receives test results from the laboratory and evaluates them before notifying
the Municipality. Prior to notifying the Municipality, the MRO will conduct a medical interview
- via phone or in the office - to discuss the individual’s medical history and other biomedical
factors. He will receive all medical history and other biomedical factors. He will receive all
medical records made available by the tested employee to determine if there might be a
legitimate medical reason for a confirmed “positive test.” If there is, the MRO will report the
test as “negative.”

42.13.3. If the MRO is unable to reach a person who tested positive, he shall report his efforts to
contact the officer to the Chief, Assistant Chief or their designee. As soon as possible, the Chief,
Assistant Chief or their designee shall request the officer to contact the MRO prior to working or
within 24 hours, whichever is sooner.

42.14. REPORTS OF DRUG TEST RESULTS

42.14.1. The Medical Review Officer will forward results only to the person designated in the
Municipality to receive such results. The MRO shall report whether an individual’s test is
negative or positive. If positive, he will identify the substance for which the test was positive.

42.15. SPLIT SAMPLE TESTING

42.15.1. After the MRO informs an employee that he will be reported to his employer as testing
positive for illegal drug use, the employee has the right to request that the “split sample” be
tested at another NIDA/DHHS laboratory. The employee must make this request in writing to
the MRO within 72 hours after the MRO-Driver evaluation call/visit. The cost of the second
laboratory analysis and MRO review will be borne by the employee. The employee will be
reimbursed by the Municipality if the split sample test is negative.

42.16. REPORTS OF ALCOHOL TEST RESULTS

42.16.1. Following a confirmed alcohol test of 0.02 or greater, the Breath Alcohol Technician
(BAT.) must immediately report the results to the Municipal representative designated to receive
this information. This is done so that the Municipality can take steps to ensure the employee
testing positive will not perform their regular duty.

42.17 CHAIN OF EVIDENCE AND STORAGE

42.17.1. Each step in the collection and processing of the urine specimen shall be documented to
establish procedural integrity and the chain-of-custody.

42.17.2. Where a positive result is confirmed, urine specimens shall be maintained in secure,
refrigerated storage for an indefinite period.

31
42.18. CONFIDENTIALITY OF DOCUMENTATION

42.18.1. If the results of the confirmatory test are positive, all documentation generated in
connection with the performance of the test including, the consent and release from, records
made in connection with specimen collection, and the test results shall be made available to both
the employee and the Chief of Police. There shall be no dissemination of said documents to the
public, except as may be necessary by a board hearing and subsequent appeals. Neither said
documentation, nor the information contained therein, shall be used for the purposes of criminal
Investigation or prosecution. Nor shall any such documentation, or the information contained
therein, be made known in connection with any request for a job reference for the employee from
outside the department, except as made public as a result of a board hearing or appeal.

42.18.2. If the results of the test are negative, or if the results of the confirmatory test indicate the
presence of only prescribed or over-the-counter medication, all documentation generated in
connection with the performance of the test including, the consent and release form, records
made in connection with specimen collection, and test results shall be maintained by the Chief of
Police in a file separate from the employee’s medical file, in strictest confidence, available only
to the employee or his representative upon production of written authorization. There shall be no
dissemination of said documents to the public, nor shall any such documentation or the
information contained therein, be made known in connection with any request for a job reference
for the employee from outside the department.

42.18.3. Any and all actions required to be taken by this order shall be effected with the utmost
discretion, and with the involvement of as few personnel as possible. Further, individuals acting
pursuant to this policy, or having knowledge of actions taken pursuant to this policy, shall not
discuss said actions with others, either within or without the Department, except as may be
required by this policy, or as may be dictated by necessity, and then such actions shall be
discussed only on a need-to-know basis.
