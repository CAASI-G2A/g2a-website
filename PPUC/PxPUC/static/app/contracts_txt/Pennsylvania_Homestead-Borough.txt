such overtime from a list of qualified employees within the ranks, excluding the Chief of Police,
on the basis of their status on the overtime seniority list. Assignments from said list shall be
rotated in descending order of seniority. The objective is to provide a reasonable procedure for
affording employees overtime work opportunities as the need arises. Once an employee is
offered overtime by the Employer, he shall not be offered another overtime assignment until all
employees on said list have been afforded the opportunity to work overtime. Any employee on

Page | 6
said list who is not available at the time the overtime work arises or declines an offer of
overtime work shall be credited for the assignment solely for the purposes of the rotation. An
employee will be considered as having been offered overtime for the purpose of determining his
place on the overtime rotation list only if direct or telephone communication is made with the
employee. The Chief of Police or his designee shall be responsible for maintaining said
overtime list and shall indicate the employees eligible for overtime assignments.

Sections 4 and 5, shall be guaranteed a minimum of four (4) hours pay, unless the employee is
scheduled for work immediately preceding or following the non-regularly scheduled work time.
In such instance, the employee shall not be guaranteed any minimum hours of pay. For
example, if the employee is scheduled to work the 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. work shift, and is
required to stay beyond the end of that work shift until 5:00p.m., he shall only be entitled to the
actual time worked of two hours.

SECTION 12: There shall be no pyramiding of overtime as a result of vacation, holidays, sick
leave, bereavement leave, jury duty leave, or a combination of weekly and daily overtime, and

offered any less hours of work per week on the regular work schedule than other part-time
police officers with lesser seniority are offered. However, if the more senior part-time police
officer refuses the additional hours of work per week on the regular police schedule, and the

Page | 7
additional work hours are given to a less senior part-time police officer, then such more senior
part-time police officer is not entitled to payment for such hours not actually worked. This
provision is only meant to apply to the regular work schedule as posted by the Employer and is
not meant to apply to manpower needs of the Employer after the regular work schedule is
posted. For example, if the regular work schedule has been posted by the Employer, and if a
part-time employee who was scheduled for work on the regular work schedule calls off for
sickness, or any other reason, then the Employer has the right to designate any part-time police
officer that it chooses to fill those vacated hours on the work schedule, without any regard for
seniority.

detail. The Police Officers, including the Chief of Police, shall be rotated in descending order of
seniority. Once the Employer offers a Police Officer a detail, it shall not offer that Police Officer
another detail until it has offered the detail to all other police officers on the list. Any Police
Officer on the list who is not available at the time the detail arises or who declines the detail
shall be credited with the detail solely for purposes of detail rotation. A police officer shall be
considered as having been offered a detail for the purpose of determining the Police Officer’s

the detail list and shall indicate the Police Officers eligible for detail assignments.

officers are acting within the scope of their duty.

SECTION 2: LIFE INSURANCE The Employer shall provide a life insurance benefit during
employment of $25,000.00 to each full-time police officer, with the benefit having a double
indemnity provision of $50,000 for accidental death, and with the full-time police officer being

insurance policy at retirement. No life insurance benefits shall be available to part-time police
officers.

SECTION 3: HEALTH INSURANCE Full-time employees will have three basic health care
options available to them for providing themselves and their families with hospitalization
coverage and medical benefits:

A. A full-time employee may choose coverage through either the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Select
Blue Program or U.S. Healthcare, for which the Employer will pay 100% of the premium; or

B. Alternatively, a full-time employee may continue to receive coverage for himself and his
family through the traditional Blue Cross\Blue Shield Plan -U format. However, the Employer
shall pay no more toward the premium for the same level of coverage (i.e., family, individual,
etc.) than it pays for the Blue Cross\Blue Shield Select Blue Program or U.S. Healthcare
coverage, and the full-time employee shall pay the premium differential.

The Borough may switch health insurance coverage to a comparable health plan at any time.

No health insurance benefits shall be provided to any part-time employees.

C. Employees who are covered by health insurance provided by the Employer may waive
(choose not to receive) the health insurance under the following terms and conditions. In
exchange, each month that the waiver is in effect, the employee will receive a payment of
$500.00. Employees, who waive the group medical insurance, their dependents will no longer
receive health insurance from the Employer.

In order to waive health insurance, the employee must:

(i) have alternative health insurance for the employee and the employee’s eligible
dependents;

(ii) complete a Waiver of (Request Not to Receive) Health Insurance form;
(ili) provide a copy of the employee’s alternative health insurance identification cards;
(iv) provide an authorization to confirm the coverage by the alternative health insurance;

(v) provide the employee’s eligible dependants’ written consent to the waiver.

Pagej 15
The waiver of health insurance and the monthly payment will not occur until the employer
confirms alternative health insurance coverage. Each waiver of health insurance will remain in
effect until revoked in writing by the employee.

Employees who do not maintain alternative health insurance coverage during the period that the
waiver is in effect will be subject to discipline and will be responsible to repay all monthly
bonus(es) received when the alternate health insurance was not in effect. Employees who
involuntarily lose their alternate health insurance through no fault of their own must submit
proof that their alternate coverage has been involuntarily terminated, and re-enroll in the
Employer’s health insurance. Involuntary re-enrollment will not be subject to any waiting
period, but will be subject to applicable enrollment procedures by the Employer’s health
insurance carrier.

Employees who waive health insurance may voluntarily re-enroll in the Employer’s health
insurance, subject to the new employee waiting period. The monthly payment will cease in the
same month that re-enrollment begins regardless of the date that re-enrollment takes effect.

benefits immediately.

subject the plan to the Affordable Care Act’s “Cadillac Tax” excise tax, the Employer shall give
the Union written notice of that fact and the parties shall immediately meet to discuss changes in
the plan design, plan and/or plan carrier in order to avoid the imposition of the tax. If no
agreement is reached within fourteen (14) days of the Employer’s written notice to the Union
regarding this issue, then the parties shall proceed to an expedited arbitration proceeding with an
arbitrator selected pursuant to the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement’s grievance
and arbitration procedure. The sole purpose for that expedited arbitration proceeding shall be
for the arbitrator to avoid the Employer’s exposure to the Cadillac Tax by changing the plan,
plan design and/or plan carrier. The decision of the arbitrator shall be issued before the date on
which the Employer must enroll the employees in the plan. If the arbitrator does not issue the
decision before the date on which the Employer must enroll the employees in the plan, then the
Employer shall select a plan for the upcoming plan year, and the arbitrator’s decision shall be
implemented in the following plan year.

have rendered had he or she continued to be employed until his or her superannuation retirement
date to the gross pension amount calculated using the monthly average salary during the
appropriate period prior to his or her termination of employment.

by actuarially reducing the partial superannuation retirement benefit to reflect that it will
commence on the effective date of the early retirement rather than on the date on which the

reduction shall be calculated using the actuarial assumptions reporting in the last actuarial
