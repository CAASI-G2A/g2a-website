does not qualify as "unduly disruptive" under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)29
U.S.C. Section 207 (0) (5). However, the Kennedy Township Policemen agree that

of the compensatory time.
b. It is specifically noted that the parties agree that a policeman may work two consecutive

shifts, nor will there be additional compensation if the policeman has voluntarily chosen to
work two consecutive shifts due to changing shift schedules with another officer.

through September 30; October 1 through December 31. It is specifically agreed, however,
that the Chief of Police may adjust the particular days so as to occur as close to the specified

Once shifts and days off are selected as specified above, and approved by the Chief of
Police, they shall remain in force and shall not be changed except as follows:
Temporary changes may be made by the Chief of Police because of sickness, injury, vacation
work load on a particular shift, and/or any emergency, if the Chief of Police finds it
necessary to make such changes.
Changes may be made by mutual consent of the Chief of Police and all affected Policemen.
Changes may be made by the Chief of Police when, in the Chief's opinion, a given policeman
is not adequately performing his duties on the shift he has selected.
The Township shall have the right to require that there be at least one ranking policeman
working on daylight (7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.) shift, at least one ranking policeman working on
afternoon (3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) and at least one ranking policeman working on night
(11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) shift. The term "Ranking Policeman" means any policeman above
the rank of patrolman, and shall include the Chief of Police, whether or not he is included in
the definition of "Policeman". The Chief of Police shall be considered as the Ranking
Policemen working on the daylight shift. Irrespective of seniority, the Deputy Chief shall
select first, and shall select either the afternoon or night shift. The remaining officers
irrespective of rank, shall select from the available shifts and days off, his desired shift and
days off, on the basis of seniority subject to the approval of the Chief of Police, with the
provision that if the Township has exercised its right to require that there be at least one
Ranking Policeman working on one each of the daylight, afternoon and night shifts, at least
one opening shall remain unselected by patrolmen on any such shift not containing a
Ranking Officer, and if by the time the shift selection process reaches the Ranking Policeman
with the lowest seniority who has not selected a shift shall select a specific shift on
whichever of the afternoon or night shifts has no Ranking Officers on any of its specific
shifts.
In case permitted temporary shift changes are made, officers shall be transferred from
whichever of the daylight, afternoon, or night shifts contains the most officers, first by
offering the shift change in seniority order, and if none elects to make the shift change, then
by transferring the policeman from shift with the least seniority.
In case the Township elects to require that one daylight, afternoon, and night shift shall be
staffed by a Ranking Officer, in the absence of a Ranking Officer on any such shift, the most
senior patrolman present on such shift where the Ranking Officer is absent shall assume the
responsibilities of the Ranking Officer and shall be compensated for such shift at the rate of
pay then applicable to the rank of Sergeant. In all other cases where a Ranking Officer is not
assigned to a particular shift, the most senior officer is not assigned to a particular shift; the
most senior patrolman shall be paid twenty cents ($.20) per hour in addition to his regular
rate of pay for all hours worked on that shift.
Scheduling shall be seniority and filling of temporary absences due to vacation, illness, etc.
shall be by reverse seniority.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, including this Article XIII,
the Township retains the right at any time to assign a Sergeant to a shift that has no Ranking
Officer and in order to do so, may bump the least senior policeman from the shift, if the
Township deems it necessary to do so. If the Township does assign a Sergeant to a shift after
all policemen have selected their shifts and days off by bidding as provided in paragraph 1 of
this Article XIII, then as between the Sergeant and the remaining policemen on the shift to
which Sergeant is assigned, days off shall be determined by departmental seniority.
