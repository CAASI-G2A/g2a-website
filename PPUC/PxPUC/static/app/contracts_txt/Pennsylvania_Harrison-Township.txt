of regular dues, fees, and assessments regarding the duration, renewal, procedure for
revocation, and all other provisions agreed to by the employee as stated in the authorization,
irrespective of the employee's membership in the Union.
B.
The Union agrees that in any legal action brought against the Township for
actions it is requested to perform in this regard the Union will defend, indemnify and hold
the Township harmless for any monetary damages the Township may be liable for as a
consequence of its compliance with this Article, except that it is expressly understood this

{DocNo-00765019.4}

5

by the parties in writing. In that event, the Township may not unilaterally implement the

arbitrator selected pursuant to the arbitration step of the grievance procedure. The decision
of the arbitrator on the issue of comparability shall be issued within forty-five (45) calendar
days of the Union's written notice contesting that the plan selected by the Township is
comparable. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and will determine if
the Township is authorized to implement the new plan.

will subject the plan to the Affordable Care Act's "Cadillac Tax" excise tax, the Township
will give the Union written notice of that fact and the parties will immediately meet to
discuss changes in the plan design, plan and/or plan carrier in order to avoid the imposition
of the tax. Ifno agreement is reached within fourteen (14) days of the Township's written
notice to the Union regarding this issue, then the parties will proceed to an expedited
arbitration proceeding with an arbitrator selected pursuant to the terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreement's grievance and arbitration procedure. The primary purpose for that
expedited arbitration proceeding will be for the arbitrator to modify the plan, plan design
and/or plan carrier in order to eliminate the exposure to the Cadillac Tax. The arbitrator's
award may, however, also address the allocation of the payment of any deductible increases
imposed the expedited award. The decision of the arbitrator on these issues shall be issued
within forty-five (45) calendar days of his or her appointment.
Any arbitration arising under this Section shall be arbitrated in accordance with
Article XXI, Section 1(C), except as modified herein.

execution of the Interest Arbitration Award the Township shall carry life insurance on

hundred dollars ($400.00) per month for health care benefits upon normal retirement

years, whichever occurs first. If at any time an Officer or his spouse becomes eligible
to receive medical benefits from any other source (prior to Medicare), benefits
provided by the Township shall cease. Officers will be required to complete a
verification form provided by the Township twice a year certifying whether they are
eligible to receive this benefit. If the Officer or spouse should then lose said medical
benefits they would be reinstated by the Township as above. The four hundred dollar
($400) per month health care allowance for retiring Officers until Medicare eligibility
or age sixty-five (65) shall be eliminated for Officers hired on or after January 26,
2016, the date the 2016 Interest Arbitration Award was executed.

1.1

DROP Provisions
(a)

Eligibility. Effective January 1, 2021 through April 30, 2022, members of the
Harrison Township Police Department who are eligible for a full superannuation
retirement benefit and have not retired prior to the implementation of the DROP
program, may enter into the DROP on the first day of any month following the
attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of twenty-five (25) or more
years of credited police service with the Township of Harrison by the member
submitting the "Written Election" requirements described in subsection l.l(b).
Upon the effective date of a DROP election, the officer shall be deemed to be
retired.

(b)

Written Election. An eligible member of the Plan electing to participate in the
DROP program must complete and execute a "Drop Election Form" prepared
by the Township Secretary, Township Manager and/or the plan administrator,
which shall evidence the member's participation in the DROP program, and
document the participant's rights and obligations under the DROP. The form
must be signed by the member and the Chief Administrative Officer of the Plan
and submitted to the Township at least 30 days before the date on which the
member wishes the DROP election to be effective. The DROP Election Form
shall include: an irrevocable notice to the Township by the member that the
member shall terminate his or her employment with the Township Police
Department effective on a specific date ("resignation date") in which they

(DocNo-00765019.4}

19

terminate employment and no later than thirty-six (36) months from the
effective date of the DROP election.

In addition, all retirement documents required by the Township Police Pension
Plan Administrator must be filed and presented to the Township Board of
Commissioners for approval of retirement and the commencement of the
monthly pension benefit. Once the retirement application has been approved by
the Township Board of Commissioners, it shall become irrevocable.
After a Participant enters the DROP Program, contributions to the Plan by the
participant and the Township will cease.
Members are hereby advised to consult a tax advisor of their choice before
considering the DROP program as there may be serious tax implications and/or
consequences to participating in the DROP program.

(c)

Limitation on Pension Accrual. After the effective date of the DROP election,
the Participant shall no longer earn or accrue additional years of continuous
service for pension purposes.

(d)

Benefit Calculation. For all Plan purposes, continuous service of a Participant
shall remain as it existed on the effective date of commencement of participation
in the DROP program. Service thereafter shall not be recognized or used for
the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the Plan. The
average monthly pay of the Participant for pension calculation purposes shall
remain as it existed on the effective date of commencement of participation in
the DROP program. Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be
recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable
by the Plan.

(e)

Payments to DROP Account. The monthly retirement benefits that would have
been payable had the Participant elected to cease employment and receive a
normal retirement benefit shall, upon the member commencing participation in
the DROP program, be credited on the first day of each month into a separate
interest bearing account established by the Plan Administrator to track and
accumulate the participant's monthly pension benefits. This account shall be
designated the DROP Account.
Interest shall be compounded and credited monthly at the actual rate earned by
the DROP participant account that shall not be less than 0.0% nor more than
4.5%. The DROP account shall be an FDIC-insured bank account or other
investment that will not lose value. The interest rate on DROP accounts shall
be no less than 0%. The account shall be managed by the Plan Administrator
pursuant to the same fiduciary obligations and principles applicable to
management of municipal pension plans. All earnings credited to the DROP
account will be included in the final cash settlement to the extent permitted by
law.

(f)

Early Termination. A Participant may withdraw from the DROP program at
any time and effectuate a complete retirement from service. No penalty shall

{DocNo-00765019.4 )

20

be imposed for early termination of DROP participation.
However, the
Participant shall not be permitted to make any withdrawals from the DROP
Account until DROP participation has ended. Upon either early or regular
termination of DROP participation the DROP Participant shall be separated
from employment with the Township and the retirement Plan shall pay the
balance in the DROP Participant's DROP Account to the terminating Participant
as provided herein and the DROP Participant shall be ineligible to re-enroll in
the DROP thereafter even if the former DROP Participant is re-employed by the
Township.

(g)

Payout. Upon the termination date set forth in the DROP Election Form or on
such date as the participant withdraws or is terminated from the DROP program,
if earlier, the normal retirement benefits payable to the participant or the
participant's beneficiary, if applicable, shall be paid directly to the participant
or beneficiary and shall no longer be credited to the DROP Account. Except in
cases of early termination addressed in paragraph (f) above, within 45 days of
the maximum period allowed by applicable law following the actual termination
of a participant's employment with the Township Police Department, the
accumulated balance in the DROP Account shall be paid to the participant, his
or her survivor or beneficiary, (1) in a single lump-sum payment, subject to any
required federal tax withholding, or (2) as a direct rollover to an eligible
retirement plan or other qualified retirement account as permitted by law or
individual retirement annuity. If the participant, his or her survivor or
beneficiary, selects the rollover option, he or she must also submit the
appropriate paperwork from the IRA or other qualified retirement plan
custodian within the required election period.

(h)

Disability During DROP. If a participant becomes eligible for a disability
pension benefit and terminates employment, the monthly normal retirement
benefit to the DROP participant shall terminate.

(i)

Death. If a Participant dies before the DROP account balance is paid, the
patticipant's beneficiary under Act 600 shall have the same rights under
applicable law as the participant to withdraw the DROP Account balance. The
monthly benefit credited to the participant's DROP Account during the month
of the participant's death shall be the final monthly benefit for DROP
participation.

1.3

Effective Date.
The effective date of the DROP program is January 1, 2021. The ability to elect
this benefit shall expire April 30, 2022.

1.4

Severability.
The provisions of the DROP Plan shall be severable, and if any of its provisions
shall be held to be unconstitutional or illegal, the validity of any of the remaining
provisions of the Plan shall not be affected thereby. It is hereby expressly
declared as the intent of the Township and Union that the DROP Plan has been
accepted as if such unconstitutional or illegal provision had not been included

[DocN0"'00765019.4)

21

herein.
1.5

Eligibility for Statutory Benefits.

A DROP Participant shall be eligible for all pre-retirement benefits for
employees otherwise provided by law including, but not limited to, the
following:
a. The Workers' Compensation Act (the Act of June 2, 1915 (P.L.

collective bargaining agreement.

1956, as amended through Act 44 of2009 (53 P.S. § 895.1001 - § 895.1131).

In the event of amendment of legislation governing DROPs in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, this DROP shall be amended to comply with
any new mandatory provisions set forth in such legislation. The application of
any amendments to police officers actively employed as of the effective date of
any such legislation shall be governed by and consistent with constitutional
principles applicable to the pension and retirement benefits.
The DROP shall be deemed to be automatically amended to the extent necessary
to remain in compliance with and/or sever any inconsistency with any change
of statutory or applicable common law. The Township may amend the terms of
the DROP ordinance without negotiation, limited, however, to the extent
necessary to remain in compliance with any changes in controlling law.
