coordinated by the officers as follows. The officers with the least amount of
overtime will be given the first opportunity for available overtime; if an officer
refuses overtime, he will be charged with the hours that were available, without
compensation.

An officer may be passed over on overtime assignments if he/she does not
respond to calls/texts at the telephone number he/she provides. No response in
this scenario carries the same consequences as an overtime refusal.

 
prereset: ei en at en i

Any officer deprived of the opportunity to work overtime under this provision will
be offered the next available opportunity for an overtime assignment.

When the rotating list for overtime has been exhausted a police officer may be
ordered to work overtime. Officers in charge (OlGs) shall replace OICs, and non-
OlCs shall replace non-OlCs. If a police officer is ordered to work overtime, that
overtime shall not be charged against the officer on the overtime rotation list.

Officers shall be required to provide a telephone number where they can be
reached when they are not on duty so they can be contacted in emergencies
and/or if personnel are needed to fill vacancies on a shift. Officers are expected
to respond to calls/texts, etc.. from the department in these instances except as
follows: if an officer is unavailable and has notified the Borough of their
unavailability with as much advance notice as is practical.

ARTICLE VI — MASTER SCHEDULE

The present system (master schedule) whereby each officer knows well in
advance his scheduled shifts and duties shall be maintained. The employer shall
establish a master schedule such as contained in Schedule D or one as similar
thereta as is practically possible in the circumstances.

The Borough will make every reasonable effort to minimize the number of
changes in a police officer's scheduled shifts set forth on the master schedule. If
a schedule change is necessary, the Borough will give the affected police officer
reasonable notice prior to the change.

Once a day off is approved in any category, it may not be moved or exchanged
with another day absent the agreement of the Borough.

The grievance arbitration decisions provided to the Parties at American
Arbitration Association Case Nos. 55-390-0144-91 (1) and (2), both of which
were rendered November 4, 1991, which decisions were found enforceable by
Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court at docket no. 48 CD 1993, body and
interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement not modified through either
collective bargaining or Act 111 Arbitration since the date of their issuance.

The Members of the Unit shall, at any time during the term of the agreement,
have the right to propose to the Chief of Police and Mayor, a Master Schedule
other than the one outlined in Schedule D. This proposed schedule should
conform to the requirements in the current definition of Mater Schedule. Once
approved by the Chief of Police and Mayor, this schedule shall replace attached
Schedule D.

ARTICLE VII - NORMAL WORKDAY IN NORMAL PAY PERIOD

A normal workday shail be twelve (12) consecutive hours of work and eighty-four (84) hours
worked in a fourteen (14) day pay period shall constitute a normal pay period. Each day shall
include a paid lunch period, subject to the member of the unit being available on call and
responding in the event of an emergency. Duty assignments, including overtime, will not be
changed or altered as a means of punishment or penalty. Officers called out for unscheduled

3

 
SSL Se

 

 
     

duty shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours at the overtime rate for said call out; provided,
however, that if an officer is called out less than four (4) hours before the start of the scheduled
shift, the officer shall be paid at the applicable overtime rate from time of call-out to the start of
the shift as opposed to the full four (4) hours.

       
 
   

Contract language pertaining to workdays shall be interpreted to mean 12-hour workdays.
Other paid days off (Vacation, Holidays, Personal ,Sick Time, Compensatory Time) shall be
converted to hours, if not otherwise specified herein, so that one party does not benefit beyond
what is offered or intended by this CBA. This conversion to hours shall not be construed to
increase the current available leave time beyond that which is currently provided to the officers.

      
   
   
  

Officers shall not be permitted to work more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours and officers
shall have 8 hours off duty between their twelve {12) hour shifts. Officers shall return to work
after all assigned court time, training days, etc.. to finish their normal workday unless otherwise
directed by the Chief.

      
 

In lieu of the normal, four (4) hours extra Straight time payment in any pay period, officers may

opt to take 8 hours of “lost time” (Vacation, Holiday, Compensatory Time) and receive 80 hours
of pay. Use of sick time by an officer negates application of this provision, as set forth in Article
XVIII(d).

     
        
 

ARTICLE Vill - SCHEDULED SHIFT CHANGES BY MUTUAL CONSENT

 
    

Members of the Unit may change scheduled shifts by mutual consent between or among

year, per officer, officers may sell back to the Borough any unused vacation time.

begun, each officer will have five (5) calendar days to make his selection from
the date he was notified. If an officer chooses not to select vacation on the first
round or within their five (5) day timeframe, they shall be passed over and the
next officer in descending seniority order may make their selection. Once the first
round has been completed those officers who have additional vacation days may
choose those additional vacation days in the same manner as the first round.

Any officer who elects not to pick their vacation choice on the first or subsequent
rounds must submit to the Chief of Police, their vacation requests as soon as the
officer knows of the need.

Once a vacation pick has been granted it cannot be “bumped” by another officer,
and vacation picks may not be withdrawn, moved, or replaced with another type
of leave unless approved by the Chief of Police.

Exception: Once a year to accommodate unforeseen plan changes, up to 5
contiguous scheduled vacation days may be moved, provided that the change
does not cause overtime and that the request is submitted 30 days in advance of
the scheduled vacation.

vacation and granting of a second or subsequent officer would involve overtime.

Otherwise, vacation request cannot be unreasonably denied and the Chief of
Police can accommodate vacation requests by changing the schedule.

Borough one old bulletproof vest at the time the Borough furnishes the officer
with a new bulletproof vest. Officers may keep one spare bulletproof vest in their
possession for use at the range and/or for use in their personal vehicle.

ARTICLE XV — HEALTH BENEFITS AND PAID PARENTAL LEAVE

The Borough shall have the right at any time during the term of this agreement to propose
equivalent coverage. Equivalent, in the context, will not mean exactly the same. Rather,
equivalent shall mean a plan having when compared as whole, benefits that are comparable to
the current coverage provided. Once presented the proposal shall be considered and voted
upon by the bargaining unit. Provided a majority of the membership approves the proposed
plan, the current agreement shall be reapened for the purpose of the adoption of the new heaith
care plan.

insurance benefits, and prescription plan coverage under the UPMC Gold HSA $2000 plan. The

of the unit, that member and his family shall be entitled to continued medical insurance
coverage under the current medical benefit plan that the members of that unit are enrolled in,
until such time as the retiree is eligible for Medicare.

The Borough shall pay fifty (60%) percent of the cost for this coverage. Once the officer
is retired the officer will pay any new rate increases imposed by the insurance carrier. The
medical benefits shall include coverage for the same benefits that the active employees are
entitled to as stated in this Article subsections a & b. Any retiree that falls under this section
shall be permitted to seek health care coverage outside the coverage provided by the Borough if

 
he so chooses. Regardless, however, the Borough’s obligation shall not exceed the 50%

waiting period, the long term disability insurance benefit shall be fifty percent (50%) of base
wages up to the cap of a maximum of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per month.

The terms and provisions of the insurance policy under which the above benefit is
provided are incorporated herein by reference thereto. The Borough further agrees to continue
to pay the hospitalization premium for any officer while on disability, but only if he/she is able to
return to work. Upon certification by competent medical opinion that the officer cannot return to
all his normal duties, such premium payment shall cease, and the officer shall be terminated for
medical reasons and have recourse to such pension as exists at the time.

The Borough will allow officers to donate accumulated Sick Leave to a “Sick Day” bank for other
employees who, owing to significant injury or illness, run out of Sick Leave. The “bank’ is
intended to bridge the gap until the affected officer meets the parameters for eligibility for Long
Term Disability insurance coverage. Donated Sick Leave will be subtracted from the donor
employee's accumulated Sick Leave and will be treated last in/first out, meaning that the most
recent accumulation is used first, and that the donation may impact eligibility for incentive pay
for Sick Leave use in a given year.

(f} The Borough will provide the means for officers to have the expense of legal aid
insurance payroll deducted at each officer's cost, provided the officer provides written
authorization of their desire for same. Arrangements for this process will be made through

because of medical illness or injury to the employee. However, the parties also understand and
agree that sick leave is not a benefit which constitutes a “right of taking”.

any abuse of sick leave.

(b) When an officer has called off sick from their regularly scheduled shift they cannot
work overtime for 24 hours from the start of the shift from which they have called off.

hours of extra pay usually designated in an 84-hour work schedule.

(f) After three (3) successive work days of absence due to illness or accident, the
Employer shall have the ability to require an officer to provide appropriate medical
documentation or undergo medical examination by a physician (employee's personal

for believing that an employee is abusing sick leave, or any other indications that an
officer is using sick leave inappropriately.

(g) The Borough will pay the hospitalization premiums for any policeman on
long term disability, with the proviso that the payment of that premium runs only until
it is determined whether the individual can return to work or not by appropriate
medical judgment. At that point, if he is certified unable to return to work, the
hospitalization premiums cease, and he would then be terminated and have
available such other pensions under Act 600 as are in existence.

(h) A bonus of $3000 shall be paid to each employee covered by this agreement who
takes no sick leave in a given calendar year; a bonus of $1500 shall be paid to each
employee covered by this agreement who takes four (4) or fewer sick days in a given

10

calendar year; and any employee covered by this agreement who takes more than
four (4) sick days in a calendar year shall receive no such bonus.

Any such bonus shall be paid in the first pay of the year following the year in which
the bonus was earned,

b. When any citizen complaint is filed greater than six (6) months after the

date of the alleged event complained of, which if true, could not lead to a criminal
charge, then such complaint shall be classified as unfounded.

Cc. If a police officer is interrogated as part of an internal investigative or
disciplinary procedure, and writes a statement as part of that investigation, or a
transcript is taken, or other mechanical record made, of statements provided by
the police officer, then a copy of the same must be given to the interrogated
police officer, without cost, upon request.

d. if any police officer under interrogation is under arrest, he shall be
completely informed of his rights prior to the commencement of the interrogation.

e. At the request of any police officer under interrogation, he shall have the
right to be represented by Bargaining Unit representative, who shall be present at
all times during the interrogation. The interrogation shall be suspended for a
reasonable period of time until representation can be obtained.

f. Unless agreed to by the officer, or unless otherwise required by law, the
Borough shall not make any public comment on the reason for any disciplinary
action brought against the officer.

ARTICLE XXIV — GRIEVANCES

For the purpose of this Agreement, the term “grievance” means any difference or
dispute between the Borough and any regular policeman with respect to the
interpretation, application, claim or breach or violation of any of the provisions of
this Agreement, as well as matters of discipline. It is understood that discipline
shall be for just cause.

It is understood that a police officer may not process a discipline matter through
the grievance/arbitration forum while simultaneously processing the same
discipline matter in the civil service forum. A police officer must select either the
grievance/arbitration forum or the civil service forum to process a discipline
matter. If the police officer receives an unfavorable decision in either the
grievance/arbitration or civil service forum, he may not process the same
discipline matter a second time in the other forum. For example, a police officer
who selects the grievance/arbitration forum and who receives an unfavorable
decision from a neutral arbitrator regarding a discipline matter may not then
process the same discipline matter in the civil service forum. An officer's initial
selection of one forum will operate as a preclusion to his utilization of

 
ESS SSS SS ST ee ee

  
 

the alternative forum to challenge the discipline at issue.

 
    

Should a grievance arise between the Borough and the policeman, there shall be
no suspension of work on account of such grievance, but the grievance shall be
settled in accordance with the grievance procedure hereinafter set forth.

    
    
 

Step One:

 
 

Any regular policeman having a grievance shall first discuss the grievance with
the Chief of Police. If, after such discussion satisfaction is not received, he may
file his grievance in writing on a form agreed upon by the parties to this
Agreement

      
    
 

Step Two:

The written grievance shall be given to the Secretary of the Council within ten
(10) days from the occurrence of the grievance, and the same shall be
considered in a meeting between Council's designee and a representative of
Teamsters Local 205.

 
       
     

Within seven (7) days thereafter, a decision shall be made by authorized
representatives of Council.

  

Step Three:

 
  

If the matter is not settled to the satisfaction of the Union or the Employer, either
party may process the grievance to binding arbitration by submitting to the other
a written notice of intent to do so within five (5) days of receipt of the Step Two
response. The arbitrator shall be selected from a panel of seven (7) arbitrators
who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators and who reside in
Western Pennsylvania, provided by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service (FMCS), with the parties alternately striking names until the arbitrator is
selected. In the first grievance under this procedure, the Borough shall make the
first strike. Thereafter, with each successive strike, the initial strike shall alternate
between the parties. The arbiter’s decision must be rendered within thirty (30)
days after the hearing, unless agree otherwise. The arbitrator shall have the
authority to order either a sharing or a full assessment of costs relative to the
arbitration procedure on the parties (or on one of the parties as the case may be)
based upon the arbitrator's analysis of the reasonableness, merit and lack of
frivolity in the positions articulated by the parties at the grievance arbitration.

   
     
   
   
   
   
    
    
   
    
      
 

The grievance, as stated in the request for arbitration, shall constitute the sole
and entire subject matter to be heard by the arbitrator unless the parties agree to
modify the scope of the hearing. The number of grievances which can be
submitted to the arbiter shall be limited to one (1) grievance unless otherwise
agreed to by both parties.

 
 
      
 

If the Borough has a grievance, it shall take it to the Grievance Committee and, if
not resolved to the Borough’s satisfaction, the Borough shall be entitled to
arbitration in the manner set forth above.

    
2 aS a ee eet SSE SSE ee es 2S SSS ee ~ |

(f) Extension of time at each step shall be only at mutual consent of the Borough
and representatives of the Unit. Time limits established shall be strictly construed
and may be extended only upon written agreement of the parties. A grievance
not filed within ten (10) days from its occurrence, or knowledge of its occurrence,
shall be denied as untimely. Grievances not appealed pursuant to the procedures
outlined above shall be resolved on the basis of the Employer's last answer.
Grievances not answered by the Employer within the time limit set forth above
shall be deemed denied and may be processed by the Union to the next step in
the grievance/arbitration process.

(g) The Borough shall not be obligated to pay any member of the Union and/or
aggrieved policeman for the time spent in processing grievances, grievance
meetings or arbitration hearings, if such meetings occur at a time other than
scheduled shifts.

ARTICLE XXV — PATROLMAN IN CHARGE OF SHIFT

Patrolmen working in charge of a shift shall receive the Sergeant's rate of pay for all
hours worked.

 

ARTICLE XXVI-— PART-TIME POLICE

The Borough shall have the right to hire part-time police officers and those officers shall
receive no benefits, rights or entitlements pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement other
than an agreed upon wage rate.

ARTICLE XXViI- UNION DUES

(a) The Borough agrees to deduct monthly Union fees, and/or uniform assessments
of the Union from the first pay each month or any Officer from whom written authorization is
received and to send such dues to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union on or before the end of
the month for which the deduction is made.

(b) A dues check-off authorization is to be voluntary, but once given it may not be
revoked until fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of the Agreement.

(c) The Union agrees to indemnify and save the Borough harmless from any and all
claims, suits, or other forms of liability arising out of deductions of money for Union dues or fair
share fees under this Article.

ARTICLE XXVIII — JOB STEWARDS

(a) The Borough recognizes the right of the Union to designate Job Stewards and
alternates. The authority of the Job Steward and alternates so designated by the
Union shall be limited and shall not exceed the following duties and activities:

1. Investigation and presentation of grievances in accordance with the
provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement;

The transmission of such messages and information which shall originate
with and are authorized by the Local Union or its Officers provided such

 
messages and information;

(a) Have not been reduced to writing

(b) If not reduced to writing, are of a routine nature and do not involve
work stoppage, slowdowns, or refusal to obey orders, or any other
interference with the Borough’s business.

Job Stewards and alternates have no authority to take strike action or any other
action interrupting the Borough’s business

The Borough recognizes these limitations upon the authority of the Job Stewards
and their alternates and shall not hold the Union liable for any unauthorized acts.
The Borough, in so recognizing such limitations shall have the authority to
impose proper discipline, including discharge, in the event the Job Steward has
taken unauthorized strike action, slowdown activity, or any work stoppage or
work interference or has acted in a matter indicating his/her approval of same, in
violation of this Agreement.

The Borough shall at no time be responsible for payment to the Job Steward for
job steward duties and activities that take place while the officer is off duty.

ORDINANCE NUMBER 881

AN ORDINANCE OF THE BOROUGH OF CASTLE SHANNON,
ALLEGHENY COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, AMENDING = THE
BOROUGH'S POLICE PENSION PLAN, ORDINANCE NUMBER 788-A,
AS AMENDED, PROVIDING FOR A DEFERRED RETIREMENT
OPTION (DROP) FORM OF BENEFIT UNDER THE EXISTING POLICE

PENSION FUND

WHEREAS, the Borough Council of the Borough of Castle Shannon has
previously enacted an ordinance establishing the Borough of Castle Shannon Police
Pension Plan (the “Plan”), Ordinance Number 788-A, as amended; and

WHEREAS, the Borough reserved the right to amend the Plan pursuant to

ORDAINED AND ENACTED as fellows:

Section 1.

The Borough of Castle Shannon Police Pension Plan (the “Plan’), Ordinance Number
788-A, as amended, is further amended to add an Article identified as Article IV - A to

read as follows:
ARTICLEIV-A
DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PROGRAM (DROP)

shall have the meaning set forth in this section, unless a different meaning is otherwise

clearly required by the context:
DROP - The Deferred Retirement Option Program created as an optional form
of benefit under the existing Castle Shannon Borough Police Pension Plan.

Subsidiary DROP Participant Account - A separate, interest bearing,
subsidiary DROP participant account established to accumulate the DROP pension

benefit for a DROP participant.

the pension plan and who has elected to participate in the DROP program.

Effective Date of Participation - The day following the effective date of the
member’s regular retirement.

Plan - The Castle Shannon Borough Police Pension Plan as it applies to
Borough of Castle Shannon police officers.

4.12. DROP Provisions.

(A) Eligibility. Effective December 1, 2010, members of the Castle Shannon
police officers’ bargaining unit that have not retired prior to the implementation of
the DROP program, may enter into the DROP on the first day of any month
following the attainment of age 55 and the completion of 25 or more years of
credited service with the Castle Shannon Police Department.

(B) Written Election. An eligible Member of the Plan electing to participate in the
DROP program must complete and execute a DROP Election Form prepared by the
Borough of Castle Shannon, which shall evidence the Member’s participation in the
DROP program, and document the Participant’s rights and obligations under the
DROP. The form must be signed by the Member and be submitted to the Borough
at least 30 days before the date on which the member wishes the DROP election to
be effective. The DROP Election Form shall include an irrevocable notice to the
Borough that the Member shail terminate from employment with the Castle
Shannon Police Department effective on a specific date (“resignation date”) no later
than thirty-six (36) months from the effective date of the DROP election. An
officer shall cease work as a Castle Shannon Borough Police Officer on the
officer's resignation date, unless the Employer terminates or honorably discharges
the officer prior to the resignation date. In addition, all retirement documents
required by the Police Pension Plan Administrator must be filed and presented to
the Borough for approval of retirement and commencement of the monthly pension
benefit. Once the retirement application has been approved by the Police Pension
Administrator, it shall become irrevocable.
After a Member enters the DROP program, contributions to the pension plan
by the Participant and the Borough on behalf of the participant will cease, and the
amount of the monthly benefits will be frozen except for any applicable cost-of-
living adjustment (COLA) increases awarded to all pension recipients.

Members may consult a Tax Advisor, of their choice, prior to considering the
DROP program, as there may be serious tax implications and/or consequences to
participating in the DROP program.

(C) Limitation on Pension Accrual. After the effective date of the DROP election,
the Participant shal] no longer earn or accrue additional years of continuous service

for pension purposes.

(D) Benefit Calculation. For all Plan purposes, continuous service of a Member
participating in the DROP program shall remain as it existed on the effective date of
commencement of participation in the DROP program. Service thereafter shall not
be recognized or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable
by the Plan. The average monthly compensation of the Member for pension
calculation purposes shall remain as it existed on the effective date of
commencement of participation in the DROP program.

(E) Payments to DROP Account. The monthly retirement benefits that would
have been payable had the member elected to cease employment and receive a
normal retirement benefit shall, upon the Member commencing participation in the
DROP program, be credited at least once a month into a separate subsidiary DROP
participant ledger account established to track and accumulate the Participant’s
monthly pension benefits. This account shall be designated the Subsidiary DROP
Participant Account. This account shall not contain a guaranteed interest rate. The
account shall be managed by the Plan Administrator pursuant to the same fiduciary
obligations and principles applicable to management of the municipal pension

plans.

A separate accounting of the DROP participant’s accrued benefit
accumulation under the DROP shall be calculated annually and provided to the
DROP participant within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year. The
interest shall be compounded and credited monthly at the actual rate earned by the
Subsidiary DROP Participant Account, which shall be equal to the investment
earnings of the Plan as a whole, further provided that such interest shall not be less
than 0% nor more than 444% per year. If the final period of DROP participation is
less than a ful] calendar year, the same rate of interest applied to the preceding
calendar year’s benefits shall be applied to such partial period of the current year.

(F) Early Termination. A Participant may change the DROP termination date to
an earlier date and thereby effectuate a complete termination from service. No
penalty shall be imposed for early termination of DROP participation. Participation
in the DROP does not guarantee the DROP participant’s employment during the
period specified for DROP participation. It is recognized that the Participant shall]
not be permitted to make any withdrawals from the Subsidiary DROP Participant
Account until DROP participation has ended.

(G) Payout. Upon the termination date set forth in the DROP Election Form or on
such date as the Participant withdraws or is terminated from the DROP program, if
earlier, the terminating DROP participant, or if deceased, the participant’s survivor
or named beneficiary, shall elect a method of receiving payment of the DROP
benefits. Distribution, regardless of the method specified, shall be made within
forty-five (45) days or the maximum period allowed by federal law following the
actual termination of a Participant’s employment with the Castle Shannon Police
Department. The following options for distribution shall be available to and
selected on the approved form by the Participant, Participant’s survivor or
beneficiary: (1) the accumulated balance in the Subsidiary DROP Participant
Account shall be paid to the Participant (or the Participant’s survivor or named
beneficiary) in a single lump-sum payment less withholding taxes; or (2) as a direct
rollover to an eligible retirement plan as defined in section 402(c)(8)(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or, in the case of an eligible retirement plan that is
an individual retirement annuity as described in section 402(c)(9) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. If the Participant, Participant’s survivor or beneficiary fails
to elect a method of payment within sixty (60) days after the Participant’s
termination date, the Borough shall pay the balance as a lump sum. If the
Participant selects a rollover option, he or she must submit all appropriate
paperwork from the IRA custodian within the required election period.

Following termination of DROP participation, the subsequently paid normal
retirement benefits payable to the Participant, participant’s survivor or the
Participant’s beneficiary shall no longer be credited to the Subsidiary DROP
Participant Account but shal] be distributed monthly pursuant to normal retirement

plan niles.

(H) Disability During DROP. If a Participant becomes eligible for a disability
pension benefit and terminates employment, the monthly normal retirement benefit
to the DROP Participant shall terminate.

G) Death. If a Participant dies before the DROP Account balance is paid, the
Participant’s surviving spouse or beneficiary shall have the same rights as the
Participant to withdraw the Subsidiary DROP Participant Account balance provided
such withdrawal does not conflict with any federal or state law. The monthly
benefit credited to the Participant's DROP Account during the month of the
Participant’s death shall be the final monthly benefit for DROP participation. In
addition, the DROP Participant’s survivor shall be eligible to receive the retirement
system death benefits normally payable in the event of the death of a retired

employee.
(J) Eligibility for Other Benefits. In accordance with the provisions of Act No.
44 of 2009, 53 P.S. §895.1101 — 895.113], a DROP Participant shall be eligible for
all pre-retirement benefits for employees provided by law, including but not limited
to the Workers’ Compensation Act, Public Safety Officers’ Benefit Act of 1976,

etc.

(K} Amendment. Any amendments to the DROP ordinance shall be consistent
with the provisions covering deferred retirement option plans set forth in any
applicable collective bargaining agreement or state or federal law, and shall be
binding upon al] future Participants and upon al] Participants who have balances in

their Subsidiary DROP Participant Accounts.

(L) Effective Date. The effective date of the DROP program will be December 1,
2010.

Ordinance shall be amended in order to meet the mandatory compliance so long as the
individual legal rights of members and DROP participants are not adversely affected
