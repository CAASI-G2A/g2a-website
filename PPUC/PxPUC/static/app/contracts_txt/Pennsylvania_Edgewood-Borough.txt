grievance in writing within five (5) days.

referred by the grievance representative within ten (10) days after the Step 1 answer to the
Mayor, who will consult with the Chairman of the Public Safety Committee. The answer to the
grievance will be subject to the approval of the Chairman of the Public Safety Committee and
will be rendered within ten (10) days.

Step 3 - In the event that no satisfactory settlement is reached in Step 2, the Union, within ten
(10) days after the Step 2 answer, shall refer the grievance to the Edgewood Borough Council,
who shall answer the grievance following the earliest practicable opportunity to call a meeting of
a quorum of the Council. The Step 3 answer to the grievance shall be made within ten (10) days
of this meeting. "Days" within the meaning of this Article shall exclude Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays.

Step 4 - In the event that a satisfactory adjustment cannot be reached between the parties as
stated above, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration. The Union shall, in writing,
notify the Mayor within seven (7) days from the Step 3 answer that they demand to arbitrate the
dispute. The arbitrator shall be selected as follows: The parties shall attempt to agree on
selection of the arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within five (5) days

of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, from which list the arbitrator shall be selected. Both
parties shall strike one (1) name, and the remaining name on the list shall be designated the
arbitrator. The expenses of the impartial arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties. There
shall be no suspensions or refusal to work during the negotiations or arbitration. A decision of

each calendar year and may accumulate such sick leave for a period not to exceed seventy (70)
days. Newly hired full time Officers shall be awarded one (1) sick day every three (3) months
after completion of their third (3rd) month which means they shall receive one (1) day after their
third, sixth, and ninth months for a total of three (3) sick days. At the end of the probationary
period, sick leave shall be prorated for the remainder of that calendar year. Employees hired
after the signing of this Agreement shall be entitled to ten (10) sick days per year.

sick leave days earned in the previous calendar year in excess of the limit of seventy (70) days

employee's regular rate. For example, if at the beginning of a calendar year an employee has a
maximum accumulation of seventy (70) sick days and only uses five (5) of them, the employee
would receive 5 day's pay in January of the following year, being one-half (1/2) of the unused
remaining 10 days times the regular rate of pay.

disability arising from such injury ceases. During the time pay for such temporary disability is
being paid, any worker’s compensation received or collected by the employee for such period
shall be deducted from pay then or thereafter becoming due or owing. This section shall be
interpreted and applied pursuant to the Pennsylvania Heart & Lung Act.
