agree that the plan or carrier selected by the Borough is “substantially comparable”, they will so
state, in writing, to the Borough within ten (10) calendar days of receiving the plan and/or the
provider and plan being presented to the Police by the Borough or such longer period as mutually
agreed to by the parties in writing, identifying the reasons. In that event, the Borough may not
unilaterally implement the proposed new plan and/or carrier provided; however, it may
immediately process the dispute before a neutral arbitrator selected pursuant to the arbitration
step of the grievance procedure. The decision of the arbitrator on this “substantially
comparable” issue shall be issued within forty-five (45) calendar days of the Police Department’s

days after receiving it to select his vacation and transmit the list to the officer next in line. After

a commensurate amount of the time off with pay the following calendar year when it is possible
to coordinate such vacation with the Chief of Police and that year’s vacation selection.
Carryover vacation cannot affect the subsequent year’s vacation selection process.
