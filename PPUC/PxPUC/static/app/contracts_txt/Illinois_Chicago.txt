FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE 
CHICAGO LODGE #7 
To the Membership of Lodge 7, 
Once again, this, the 9th Agreement between the Fraternal Order of Police, Chicago Lodge 7 and the City of Chicago delineates the most recently ne­gotiated changes to the last Contract, which ended on July 1, 2012. On October 18, 2014, 66.5% of the active Membership voted to approve this Contract, which runs through June 30, 2017. To have ratified this Agree­ment by such a significant margin when the Lodge was in the midst of organizational turmoil is truly a remarkable feat. 
This was an extremely difficult negotiation process. For the first time in Lodge 7’s collective bargaining history, the FOP was the last bargaining unit to negotiate with the City. Furthermore, what took place prior to the settlement for this Contract was one of the most unique negotiation proc­esses that both sides had ever experienced. On a personal note, and as an individual that has written and implemented advanced public sector negotiation training sessions and contract negotiation experiments, I can attest to the unorthodox environment that existed prior to the present Board’s involvement in the process. Immediately, internal roles and re­sponsibilities needed to be re-addressed in order to advance our position. 
The professionalism that was regularly demonstrated by the Lodge’s labor attorneys deserve our appreciation and endless accolades as they worked seamlessly and tirelessly to deal with multiple FOP administrations and work towards presenting a new contract to the Membership. 
Speaking of accolades, Chicago Lodge 7 is the largest FOP Lodge in the Country. Presently, many look upon Law Enforcement with an accusatory and suspicious eye. Despite this negative environment, we strive to make communities safe. We defend those who cannot defend themselves. We show compassion when necessary and exhibit might when we have no alternative. The over 17,000 Members of Lodge 7 have withstood many changes, some wonderfully positive and some not. Administrations of this long standing and righteous organization come and go; but it is the Lodge Membership that carries on. It is the Membership that makes this organi­zation what it was, what it is today and what it will continue to be tomorrow. Each and every Member of Chicago Lodge 7 needs to be applauded. The Lodge will continue to move forward, but only because of the strength and tenacity of its Membership. Each and every Member has my personal ap­preciation, respect and admiration. You are certainly a group to be admired. I am humbled to be able to work on your behalf. 
Be Safe and God Bless the Police, 
Dean C. Angelo, Sr. 
President 
Fraternal Order of Police, Chicago Lodge 7

ARTICLE 1— PREAMBLE 
This Agreement is entered into by and between the City of Chicago, an Illinois municipal corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Employer") and the Fraternal Order of Police, Chicago Lodge No. 7 (hereinafter referred to as the "Lodge"). 
It is the purpose of this Agreement and it is the intent of the parties hereto to establish and promote mutual harmonious understanding and relationships between the Employer and the Lodge, to promote departmental efficiency and effectiveness, to establish wages, hours, standards and other terms and conditions of employment for Officers covered by this Agreement, and to provide for the equitable and peaceful adjustment and resolution of differences which may arise from time to time over the negotiations, interpretation and application of this Agreement. 
In consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto, by their duly authorized representative and/or agents, do mutually covenant and agree as follows: 
ARTICLE 2 — RECOGNITION 
The Employer recognizes the Lodge as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative for all sworn Police Officers below the rank of sergeant (herein referred to as "Officer") excluding probationary officers employed by the Employer in its Department of Police, provided said probationary period shall not extend beyond an eighteen (18) month period. 
The normal probationary period shall consist of eighteen (18) months of actual presence during active duty. Consequently, time absent from duty or not served, for any reason, shall not apply toward satisfaction of the probationary period, except as provided in Appendix P. During the probationary period, an officer is not entitled to any rights, privileges or benefits under this Agreement, except as provided in Appendix P. 
Officers covered by the Agreement who have completed their probationary period as defined in Article 2 of the Agreement and thereafter commence disability or approved leaves of absence but subsequently return to active duty shall not be considered probationary and shall be entitled to all rights and benefits provided for in the Agreement, including, but not limited to, the right to invoke the provisions of Article 9 of the Agreement. 
ARTICLE 3 — LODGE SECURITY 
Section 3.1 — Maintenance of Membership and Agency Shop 
A. Each Officer who on the effective date of this Agreement is a member of the Lodge, and each Officer who becomes a member after that date, shall, as a condition of employment, maintain their membership in good standing in the Lodge during the term of this Agreement. 
B. Any present Officer who is not a member of the Lodge shall, as a condition of employment, be required to pay fair share (not to exceed the amount of Lodge dues) of the cost of the collective bargaining process and contract administration. All Officers hired on or after the effective date of this Agreement and who have not made application for membership shall, on or after the thirtieth day following the completion of their probationary period, also be required to pay a fair share of the cost of the collective bargaining process and contract administration. 
Section 3.2 — Lodge Presentation at Orientation 
With respect to new officers, the Employer shall provide the Lodge with written notice of a class of new officers and shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, provide the Lodge with access to the new officers on the day when the new officers are presented with 
benefits information, which typically occurs no later than the conclusion of the second week of classes at the Academy. The Employer shall also grant the Lodge an opportunity during the orientation of new officers to present the benefits of membership in the Lodge. 
Section 3.3 — Dues Deduction 
A. With respect to any Officer on whose behalf the Employer receives written authorization in a form agreed upon by the Lodge and the Employer, the Employer shall deduct from the wages of the Officer the dues and/or financial obligations uniformly required and shall forward the full amount to the Lodge by the tenth (10th) day of the month following the month in which the deductions are made. The amounts deducted shall be in accordance with a schedule to be submitted to the Employer by the Lodge. Authorization for such deduction shall be irrevocable unless revoked by written notice to the Employer and the Lodge during the fifteen (15) day period prior to the expiration of this contract. The Employer will not similarly deduct the dues of any other organization as to Officers covered by this Agreement. 
B. With respect to any Officer on whose behalf the Employer has not received a written authorization as provided for in Section 3.3A above, the Employer shall deduct from the wages of the Officer, the fair share financial obligation, including any retroactive amount due and owing, and shall forward said amount to the Lodge by the tenth (10th) day of the month following the month in which the deduction is made, subject only to the following: 
1. 
The Lodge has certified to the Employer that the affected Officer has been delinquent in his or her obligation for at least sixty (60) days; 

2. 
The Lodge has certified to the Employer that the affected Officer has been notified in writing of the obligation and the requirement of each provision of this Article; 

3. 
The Lodge has certified to the Employer that the affected Officer has been given a reasonable opportunity to prepare and submit any objections to the payment and has been afforded an opportunity to appear before the Board of Directors of the Lodge or its designee for the purpose of being heard on said objections. 


Section 3.4 — Indemnity 
The Lodge shall indemnify and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that shall arise out of, or by reason of, action taken by the Employer for the purpose of complying with the above provisions of this Article, or in reliance on any list, notices, certification or assignment furnished under any of such provisions.

Inherent managerial functions, prerogatives and policymaking rights, whether listed above or not, which the Employer has not expressly restricted by a specific provision of this Agreement are not in any way, directly or indirectly, subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures contained herein, provided that no right is exercised contrary to or inconsistent with other terms of this Agreement. 
ARTICLE 5 — NO STRIKE 
Section 5.1 — No Strike Commitment 
Neither the Lodge nor any Officer will call, institute, authorize, participate in, sanction, encourage, or ratify any strike, work stoppage, or other concerted refusal to perform duties by any Officer or Officer group, or the concerted interference with, in whole or in part, the full, faithful and proper performance of the duties of employment with the Employer. Neither the Lodge nor any Officer shall refuse to cross any picket line, by whomever established. 
Section 5.2 — Resumption of Operations 
In the event of action prohibited by Section 5.1 above, the Lodge immediately shall disavow such action and request the Officers to return to work, and shall use its best efforts to achieve a prompt resumption of normal operations.

Section 5.4 — Discipline of Strikers 
Any Officer who violates the provisions of Section 5.1 of this Article shall be subject to immediate discharge. Any action taken by the Employer against any Officer who participates in action prohibited by Section 5.1 above shall not be considered as a violation of this Agreement and shall not be subject to the provisions of the grievance procedure; except that the issue whether an Officer in fact participated in a prohibited action shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. 
ARTICLE 6 — BILL OF RIGHTS 
Section 6.1 — Conduct of Disciplinary Investigation 
All complaints against an Officer covered by this Agreement shall be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Appendix L. 
Whenever an Officer covered by this Agreement is the subject of a disciplinary investigation other than Summary Punishment, the interrogation will be conducted in the following manner: 
A. The interrogation of the Officer, other than in the initial stage of the investigation, shall be scheduled at a reasonable time, preferably while the Officer is on duty, or if feasible, during daylight hours. 
B. The interrogation, depending upon the allegation, will normally take place at the Officer's unit of assignment, the Independent Police Review Authority (“IPRA”), the Internal Affairs Division (“IAD”) or other appropriate location. 
C. Prior to an interrogation, the Officer under investigation shall be informed of the identities of: the person in charge of the investigation, the designated primary interrogation officer, the designated secondary interrogation officer, if any, and all persons present during the interrogation and shall be advised whether the interrogation will be audio recorded. When a formal statement is being taken, questions directed to the Officer under interrogation shall first be asked by the designated primary interrogator. Unless both parties agree, no more than two members of IPRA or IAD will be present in the interview room during questioning. A secondary interrogator may participate in the interrogation, provided that the secondary interrogator shall be present for the entire interrogation. The secondary interrogator will not ask any questions until the primary interrogator has finished asking questions and invites the secondary interrogator to ask questions. Generally, the secondary interrogator will ask follow-up questions for clarification purposes. The primary interrogator will not ask any questions until the secondary interrogator has finished asking questions and invites the primary interrogator to ask follow-up questions. 
D. Unless the Superintendent of Police specifically authorizes in writing, no complaint or allegation of any misconduct concerning any incident or event which occurred five (5) years prior to the date the complaint or allegation became known to the Department shall be made the subject of a Complaint Register investigation or be re-opened or re-investigated after five (5) years from the date the Compliant Register number was issued. 
No anonymous complaint made against an Officer shall be made the subject of a Complaint Register investigation unless the allegation is a violation of the Illinois Criminal Code, the criminal code of another state of the United States or a criminal violation of a federal statute. 
No anonymous complaint regarding residency or medical roll abuse shall be made the subject of a Complaint Register investigation until verified. No ramifications will result regarding issues other than residency or medical roll abuse from information discovered during an investigation of an anonymous complaint regarding residency or medical roll abuse, unless of a criminal nature as defined in the preceding paragraph. 
E. Immediately prior to the interrogation of an Officer under investigation, he or she shall be informed in writing of the nature of the complaint and the names of all complainants. 
F. The length of interrogation sessions will be reasonable, with reasonable interruptions permitted for personal necessities, meals, telephone calls and rest.

H. An Officer under investigation will be provided with a copy of any and all statements he or she has made that are audio recorded or in writing within seventy-two (72) hours of the time the statement was made. In the event a re-interrogation of the Officer is required within the seventy-two- (72-) hour period following the initial interrogation, the Officer will be provided with a copy of any prior statements before the subsequent interrogation. 
I. If the allegation under investigation indicates a recommendation for separation is probable against the Officer, the Officer will be given the statutory administrative proceedings rights, or if the allegation indicates criminal prosecution is probable against the Officer, the Officer will be given the constitutional rights concerning self-incrimination prior to the commencement of interrogation. 
J. An Officer under interrogation shall have the right to be represented by counsel of his or her own choice and to have that counsel present at all times during the interrogation, and/or at the request of the Officer under interrogation, he or she shall have the right to be represented by a representative of the Lodge, who shall be either anOfficer on leave to work for the Lodge or a retired Officer working for the Lodge. The interrogation shall be suspended for a reasonable time until representation can be obtained. 
K. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize the Employer, IPRA and IAD to require Officers under interrogation to provide audio recorded statements, provided that the provisions in Section 6.1 are satisfied. 
L. If an Officer provides a statement during the investigation conducted promptly following a shooting incident and then is later interrogated by the Employer, IPRA or IAD as part of an investigation related to such incident, the Officer shall be provide with a copy of the portion of any official report that purportedly summarizes his or her prior statement before the interrogation. 
M. If, prior to taking an Officer’s statement, the Employer, IPRA or IAD is in possession of video or audio evidence relevant to the matter under investigation, it may, in its discretion, elect to advise or not to advise the Officer of such fact and, further, may allow or not allow the Officer an opportunity to review the video or audio evidence prior to taking the Officer’s statement. An Officer who is not allowed to review the video or audio evidence prior to giving a statement shall not be charged with a Rule 14 violation unless the Officer has been presented with the video or audio evidence and given the opportunity to clarify and amend the Officer’s original statement. In any event, the Employer shall not charge an Officer with a Rule 14 violation unless it has determined that: (1) the Officer willfully made a false statement; and (2) the false statement was made about a fact that was material to the incident under investigation.  
N. When the Department relieves an Officer of police powers, except in instances involving confidential investigations, the Department shall be required to give that Officer written notification of the category of the allegations or events that have caused the Officer to be relieved of police powers. Said notification shall be given at the time that the Officer is relieved of police powers. 
Section 6.2 — Witness Officer's Statements in Disciplinary Investigations 
When an Officer covered by this Agreement is required to give a statement, in the presence of an observer, as a witness in a disciplinary investigation other than Summary Punishment, or as a witness in a police-related shooting investigation, at the request of the Officer the interview shall be conducted in the following manner: 
A. The interview of the Officer shall be scheduled at a reasonable time, preferably while the Officer is on duty, or if feasible, during daylight hours. 
B. The interview, depending on the nature of the investigation, will normally take place at the Officer's unit of assignment, IPRA, IAD or other appropriate location. 
C. Prior to an interview, the Officer being interviewed shall be informed of the identities of: the person in charge of the investigation, the designated primary interviewing officer, the designated secondary interviewing officer, if any, and all persons present during the interview; whether the interview is being audio recorded; and the nature of the complaint, including the date, time, location and relevant R.D. number, if known. When a formal statement is being taken, questions directed to the Officer being interviewed shall be first asked by the designated primary interviewer. Unless both parties agree, no more than two members of IPRA or IAD will be present in the interview room during questioning. A secondary interviewer may participate in the interview, provided that the secondary interviewer shall be present for the entire interview. The secondary interviewer will not ask any questions until the primary interviewer has finished asking questions and invites the secondary interviewer to ask questions. Generally, the secondary interviewer will ask follow-up questions for clarification purposes. The primary interviewer will not ask any questions until the secondary interviewer has finished asking questions and invites the primary interviewer to ask follow-up questions.  
D. The Officer will be provided with a copy of any and all statements he or she has made that are audio recorded or in writing within seventy-two (72) hours of the time the statement was made. In the event a re-interview of an Officer is required within the seventy-two (72) hour period following the initial interview, the Officer will be provided with a copy of such statements before the subsequent interview. 
E. An Officer being interviewed pursuant to this section shall, upon his or her request, have the right to be represented by counsel of his or her own choice and to have that counsel present at all times during the interview, or at the request of the Officer being interviewed, he or she shall have the right to be represented by a representative of the Lodge who shall be either an Officer on leave to work for the Lodge or a retired Officer working for the Lodge. For purposes of this paragraph E, "represented" shall mean that the Officer's counsel and/or representative shall only advise the Officer but shall not in any way interfere with the interview. The interview shall be postponed for a reasonable time, but in no case more than forty-eight (48) hours from the time the Officer is informed of the request for an interview and the general subject matter thereof and his or her counsel or representative can be present. 
Interviews in shooting cases may be postponed for no more than two hours; provided, however, that if a witness Officer advances a claim that he or she is physically or emotionally unable to provide a statement within the two hour time period, then IPRA will deal with such claims on an individual basis, making a reasonable inquiry into the reasons for the Officer’s claim, and accepting at face value all good faith claims of an Officer’s inability to provide a statement. 
F. This Section 6.2 shall not apply to: questions from a supervisor in the course of performing his or her normal day-to-day supervisory duties or to requests to prepare detailed reports or To­From-Subject Reports, except To-From-Subject Reports that relate to the police-related shooting. 
G. The length of interviews will be reasonable, with reasonable interruptions permitted for personal necessities, meals, telephone calls and rest. 
H. The provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize the Employer, IPRA and IAD to require Officers being interviewed to provide audio recorded statements, provided that the provision in Section 6.2 are satisfied. 
I. If an Officer provides a statement during the investigation conducted promptly following a shooting incident and then is later interviewed by the Employer, IPRA or IAD as part of an investigation related to such incident, the Officer shall be provided with a copy of the portion of any official report that purportedly summarizes his or her prior statement before the interview. 
J. If, prior to taking an Officer’s statement, the Employer, IPRA or IAD is in possession of video or audio evidence relevant to the matter under investigation, it may, in its discretion, elect to advise or not to advise the Officer of such fact and, further, may allow or not allow the Officer an opportunity to review the video or audio evidence prior to taking the Officer’s statement. An Officer who is not allowed to review the video or audio evidence prior to giving a statement shall not be charged with a Rule 14 violation unless the Officer has been presented with the video or audio evidence and given the opportunity to clarify and amend the Officer’s original statement. In any event, the Employer shall not charge an Officer with a Rule 14 violation unless it has determined that: (1) the Officer willfully made a false statement; and (2) the false statement was made about a fact that was material to the incident under investigation.  
Section 6.3 — Non-Adoption of Ordinance 
The City of Chicago shall not adopt any ordinance and the Department shall not adopt any regulation which prohibits the right of an Officer to bring suit arising out of his or her duties as an Officer. 
Section 6.4 — Photo Dissemination 
No photo of an Officer under investigation shall be made available to the media prior to a conviction for a criminal offense or prior to a decision being rendered by the Police Board, except where required by law. 
Section 6.5 — Compulsion of Testimony 
The Department shall not compel an Officer under investigation to speak or testify before, or to be questioned by any nongovernmental agency relating to any matter or issue under investigation. 
Section 6.6 —Auto-Residency Card. 
No Officer shall be required to submit the information now required in an Auto-Residency Card as it applies to any other member of his or her family or household. 
Section 6.7 — Polygraph 
No Officer shall be disciplined for refusal to take a polygraph exam and the results of the polygraph exam shall not be admissible as evidence in proceedings before the Police Board or in any proceeding where the Officer may appeal to the Police Board, unless by Illinois or Federal Court decision or statute, such evidence shall become admissible before the Police Board. 
In the event that the results of a polygraph exam become admissible as evidence before the Police Board and the Department determines a polygraph exam is necessary, the complainant will be requested to take a polygraph exam first. If the complainant refuses to take a polygraph exam, the accused police Officer will not be requested to take a polygraph exam. If the complainant takes the polygraph exam and the results indicate deception, the accused Officer may be requested to take a polygraph exam covering those issues wherein the examiner determines that the complainant is truthful. 
When the polygraph is used, the accused member will be advised twenty-four (24) hours prior to the administering of the test, in writing, of any questions to which the Department will request an answer. 
Section 6.8 — Disclosure 
An Officer shall not be required to disclose any item of his or her property, income, assets, source of income, debts, or personal or domestic expenditures (including those of any member of his or her family or household) unless such information is reasonably necessary to monitor the performance of the Officer's job, violations of reasonable Employer rules, statutes, ordinances, or this Agreement. In the administration of fringe benefits applicable to all employees of the Employer, Officers covered by this Agreement may be required to disclose any coverage they (including any member of their families or households) may have under health or medical insurance and the name and appropriate identification of the carrier and coverage. The parties agree that the disclosure of such personal information shall not be made available for public inspection or copying because such would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of the Officer, and/or is intended to otherwise be exempt from any state or local freedom of information statute, ordinance or executive order. 
Section 6.9 — Media Information Restrictions 
The identity of an Officer under investigation shall not be made available to the media unless there has been a criminal conviction or a decision has been rendered by the Police Board (or by the Superintendent), except where required by law. However, if the Officer is found innocent, the Officer may request and the Department shall issue a public statement. 
Section 6.10 — Prohibition on Use and Disclosure of Social Security Numbers 
The Social Security Number of an Officer covered by this Agreement shall not be disclosed and shall not be included on documents, except those essential for payroll or compensation purposes. 
Section 6.11 — Mediation 
At any time during an investigation, the parties may agree to mediate the resolution of the Complaint Register investigation. The "parties" shall mean the accused Officer, with or without his or her Lodge representative, and a representative of IAD or IPRA, as appropriate. The IAD/IPRA investigator assigned to the case will not be present at the mediation. 
Prior to the mediation session, IAD/IPRA shall cause the accused Officer to be served with a Notice of Administrative Rights and a Notice of Charges and Allegations, which will include the rule violation and the factual basis therefore. Neither party is required to meet. 
The representatives at the meeting shall discuss the allegations and IAD's/IPRA's position regarding the finding of the case. The parties shall discuss whether they can reach accord as to a disposition. By accepting the discipline, the accused Officer is waiving his or her right to grieve or appeal the decision, and the accused Officer is not required to submit any statement or response. If the accused Officer does not agree with IAD's/IPRA's position, the disciplinary process will continue as designated. 
Statements made and information relayed at the mediation which are not included in the file will not be used against the Officer or included in the file at any later date. 
If IAD/IPRA and the accused Officer agree on a penalty less than separation, it is binding on both parties. However, the Superintendent retains the right to seek the separation of an Officer. 
Section 6.12 — Review Procedures 
The procedures for the review of recommendations for discipline, such as Command Channel Review, and the procedures by which Officers covered by the Agreement may challenge the recommendation and imposition of discipline which currently exist will continue to exist and be available to said Officers except as expressly modified or eliminated as set forth in the Agreement. 
ARTICLE 7 — SUMMARY PUNISHMENT 
Section 7.1 —Administration of Summary Punishment 
It is agreed that the provisions contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to Summary Punishment action, which action shall be considered as an alternative to formal disciplinary procedures, provided that in each such action the following shall apply: 
A. The Summary Punishment which may be administered conforms to the "Notice to Supervisors Regarding Progressive Discipline," as set forth in this Agreement, and is limited to: 
1. 
reprimand; 

2. 
excusing a member for a minimum of one day to a maximum of three days without pay. 


In all instances, the Summary Punishment shall be satisfied by deducting the equivalent of day(s) off without pay from the Officer’s accumulated compensatory time or, at the Officer’s sole discretion, by deducting the equivalent of day(s) off without pay from the Officer’s furlough, personal days, or baby furlough days. In all instances, eight hours of accumulated elective time, including compensatory time, furlough, personal days, and baby furlough days, shall be equal to one day off without pay. If the Officer does not have sufficient accumulated compensatory time, then the days off shall be satisfied by means of days off without pay, unless the Officer elects to use his furlough, personal days, or baby furlough days. 
B. The Department shall promulgate, maintain and publicize reasonable guidelines which will specify those acts, omissions or transgressions, the violation of which will subject an Officer to Summary Punishment action, and the penalties for each such violation, which shall be uniformly applied. 
Section 7.2 — Challenge of Summary Punishment 
After Summary Punishment has been administered three (3) times within a twelve (12) month period, an Officer who wishes to contest the application of Summary Punishment on a fourth occasion within the last twelve (12) months may contest the fourth and/or succeeding applications of Summary Punishment by timely challenge through the Complaint Register process or the grievance procedure. 
ARTICLE 8 — EMPLOYEE SECURITY 
Section 8.1 — Just Cause Standard 
No Officer covered by this Agreement shall be suspended, relieved from duty or otherwise disciplined in any manner without just cause. 
Section 8.2 — File Inspection 
The Employer's personnel files, disciplinary history files and completed inactive investigative files, except for information which the Employer deems to be confidential, shall be open and available for inspection by the affected Officer during regular business hours. 
Section 8.3 — Limitation on Use of File Material 
It is agreed that any material and/or matter not available for inspection, such as provided in Section 
8.2 above, shall not be used in any manner or any forum adverse to the Officer's interests. 
Section 8.4 — Use and Destruction of File Material  
All disciplinary investigation files, disciplinary history card entries, IPRA and IAD disciplinary records, and any other disciplinary record or summary of such record other than records related to Police Board cases, will be destroyed five (5) years after the date of the incident or the date upon which the violation is discovered, whichever is longer, except that not sustained files alleging criminal conduct or excessive force shall be retained for a period of seven (7) years after the date of the incident or the date upon which the violation is discovered, whichever is longer, and thereafter, cannot be used against the Officer in any future proceedings in any other forum, except as specified below, unless the investigation relates to a matter which has been subject to either civil or criminal court litigation or arbitration prior to the expiration of the five- (5-) year period. In such instances, the Complaint Register case files normally will be destroyed immediately after the date of the final arbitration award or the final court adjudication, unless a pattern of sustained infractions exists. 
Any information of an adverse employment nature which may be contained in any unfounded, exonerated, or otherwise not sustained file, shall not be used against the Officer in any future proceedings. Information contained in files alleging excessive force or criminal conduct which are not sustained may be used in future disciplinary proceedings to determine credibility and notice. 
A finding of "Sustained — Violation Noted, No Disciplinary Action" entered upon a member's disciplinary record or any record of Summary Punishment may be used for a period of time not to exceed one (1) year and shall thereafter be removed from the Officer's disciplinary record and not used to support or as evidence of adverse employment action. The Department's finding of "Sustained — Violation Noted, No Disciplinary Action" is not subject to the grievance procedure. 
Reprimands and suspensions of one (1) to five (5) days will stay on the Officer’s disciplinary history for a period of three (3) years from the last date of suspension or date of reprimand, or five (5) years from the date of the incident, whichever is earlier. 
Information relating to a preventable traffic accident involving a Department Vehicle may be used and/or considered in determining future discipline for a period of time not to exceed two (2) years from the date of such preventable traffic accident and shall thereafter not be used and/or considered in any employment action provided there is no intervening preventable traffic accident involving a Department Vehicle and if there is, the two-year period shall continue to run from the date of the most recent preventable traffic accident and any prior incidents may be used and/or considered in employment actions. In no event shall any prior incident five (5) or more years old be used and/or considered. 
Section 8.5 — Notification 
In the event the Employer receives subpoena or other legal process requiring the inspection, tender or submission of personnel, disciplinary or investigative records and/or files (other than Grand Jury subpoena or other subpoena or process which would preclude disclosure), the Employer will promptly send a copy of such subpoena or process to the Officer whose records have been requested and to the Lodge. However, failure to furnish such notice shall not in any way affect the validity of any disciplinary action or personnel action taken by the Employer, provided that the Lodge will not be barred from asserting and does not waive any right(s) an Officer may have to inspect or to otherwise challenge the use of files under applicable rules, statutes or this Agreement including Article 8. 
Section 8.6 — Detectives, Evidence Technicians, Police Laboratory Technicians, Forensic Investigators and Field Training Officers 
The Employer agrees not to remove Officers in the position of Detective except for just cause. 
During this Agreement, the Employer agrees that the ranks of Detective, Evidence Technician, Police Laboratory Technician, Forensic Investigator and Field Training Officer will not be eliminated from the budget. 
Section 8.7 — Tactical Response Reports (TRR) 
The number of Tactical Response Reports (TRR), in and of itself, will not be used for disciplinary purposes. 
Section 8.8 — Superintendent's Authority 
The Superintendent's authority to suspend an Officer, as set forth in section 2-84030 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, shall be increased from the current limit not to exceed thirty (30) days, to a limit not to exceed three hundred and sixty-five (365) days. 
In cases where the Superintendent seeks an Officer's separation from the Department, the Superintendent's current and past practice of suspending Officers for thirty (30) days and filing charges with the Police Board seeking the Officer's separation will not change. 
ARTICLE 9 — GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE  
Section 9.1 — Definition and Scope 
A grievance is defined as a dispute or difference between the parties to this Agreement concerning interpretation and/or application of this Agreement or its provisions. Summary Punishment shall be excluded from this procedure, except as provided in Article 7.2. The separation of an Officer from service is cognizable only before the Police Board and shall not be cognizable under this procedure, provided, however, that the provisions of Article 17 shall be applicable to separations. 
Section 9.2 — Procedures, Steps and Time Limits for Standard Grievances 
A grievance may be initiated by the Lodge or an aggrieved Officer. Any Officer shall have the right to present a grievance at any time, although it is understood that the Officer should attempt to satisfy his or her concerns on an informal basis before invoking the procedure. In the event an informal resolution proves to be unsatisfactory, a grievance may be filed in a form to be agreed upon between the Lodge and Employer and shall be processed in accordance with this Agreement. Upon request, the grievant shall be represented by an appropriate Lodge representative, provided, however, the grievant Officer may have the grievance adjusted without a Lodge representative, so long as such adjustment is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. 
Step One: Initiating a Grievance. The grievant will first submit his or her grievance in writing to his or her immediate supervisor in his or her unit of assignment within seven (7) of the Officer's working days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance or where first known by the grievant, or thirty-five (35) days, whichever period is shorter. The grievance will be reduced to writing on a pre-printed, standard grievance form set agreed upon between the Lodge and Employer. 
Step Two: Supervisory Responses. Within seven (7) days of receipt of the member's grievance, the supervisor will respond to the grievance on the grievance form set and then immediately present the grievance form set to the Commanding Officer of the unit of assignment. Following the submission of the written grievance, the Commanding Officer shall render a decision in writing within fourteen (14) days of receiving the grievance. The response shall be written on the bottom portion of the pre-printed, standard grievance form set. The Commanding Officer must forward one (1) copy of his or her decision to the grievant, one (1) copy to the Lodge's unit representative, and three (3) copies to Management and Labor Affairs Section (MLAS). MLAS will then forward to the Lodge a copy of the Commanding Officer's decision within fourteen (14) days of its receipt. If the grievant is directed by the Employer to meet concerning his or her grievance at a time when the Officer is not scheduled to work, he or she shall be compensated for such time at the applicable rate provided for in this Agreement, including the provisions of Article 20. 
Step Three: Mediation. If the response at Step Two is not satisfactory to the grievant and the Lodge, the Lodge and MLAS will meet for the purpose of mediation of the grievance. Either party may request the presence of a Mediator at such meeting, the selection of whom shall be mutually agreed upon. The mediation meeting shall be conducted no less than once each month between the Lodge Grievance Chairman, Lodge President or his or her designee and a Department representative having authority to resolve the grievance. The parties shall split evenly the cost of the Mediator's expenses and fees. 
Step Four: Arbitration. If the parties cannot resolve the grievance at Step Three, either party may at any time demand arbitration. 
Section 9.3 — Arbitration of Standard Grievances 
If either party proceeds to arbitration, the following procedure shall apply: 
A. Within ten (10) days, the Employer and the Lodge shall attempt to mutually agree upon an Arbitrator. If they fail to agree, a list of seven (7) qualified neutrals shall be requested from the American Arbitration Association. Within five (5) days after receipt of the list, the parties shall select an Arbitrator. Both the Employer and Lodge each shall alternately strike names from the list. The remaining person shall be the Arbitrator. 
B. The Employer or the Lodge, by mutual agreement, may submit a grievance involving an issue not otherwise covered under Section 9.6 of this Agreement to expedited arbitration pursuant to the rules set forth in Appendix M or under rules to be determined by the parties by mutual agreement. 
C. The parties shall avoid continuances. Requests for continuances are disfavored and shall be granted only upon showing good cause. 
Section 9.4 — Psychological Review 
Grievances concerning involuntary removal from active duty due to psychological or psychiatric reasons will comply with the following procedures: 
Step One: An Officer who wants to challenge the Employer's decision to place him or her involuntarily on the medical roll will file a grievance with the Medical Services Section within ten 
(10) calendar days of being placed on the medical roll, or if the member was on full authorized furlough during his or her involuntary placement, within thirty-five (35) calendar days of being placed on the medical roll. 
If the Employer's psychiatrist/psychologist recommends that the Officer is fit for full duty and also was fit when he or she was involuntarily placed on the medical roll due to psychological or psychiatric reasons, the Officer shall have any paid medical time used during such period of being involuntarily placed on the medical roll restored and will be made whole for lost pay and other benefits to which he or she is entitled. 
Step Two: For a member who has filed a timely grievance at Step One, and/or when the Employer's psychiatrist/psychologist recommends that the Officer is unfit for full duty and was also unfit when he or she was involuntarily placed on the medical roll due to psychological or psychiatric reasons, then upon written request made by the Lodge within ten (10) calendar days of notice to the member that he or she is unfit for duty, the Lodge may file a grievance at Step Two and may request review of that decision by a three-member psychological review panel (“Panel”). The Officer shall, as promptly as feasible, be evaluated by a panel of three psychiatrists or psychologists, one appointed by the Lodge, one appointed by the Employer and a third appointed by mutual agreement of the Employer's and the Lodge's psychiatrist or psychologist knowledgeable about police duties. This Panel shall have the authority to examine and evaluate the Officer, and recommend whether or not the Officer is fit for duty. In making its recommendations, the primary considerations of the Panel shall be the protection and safety of, and need for effective service to, the public. These considerations shall prevail over all others in any case of conflict of interests between the Officer and the Employer. 
If the Panel recommends that the Officer is fit for duty, and was also fit when he or she was placed involuntarily on the medical roll due to psychological or psychiatric reasons, then the Officer shall have any paid medical time used during such involuntary period on the medical roll restored, and will be made whole for lost pay and other benefits to which he or she is entitled. 
If the Panel determines that the member was unfit for duty at the time he or she was involuntarily placed on the medical roll, but became fit for duty sometime thereafter, the Panel shall identify the point at which the member was fit for duty and the member will be made whole for lost pay and benefits from the date that the panel determined he or she was fit for duty. 
Each party shall bear the full cost of the Panel member appointed by it, with the cost of the mutually-appointed Panel member to be split equally between the parties. The recommendations of the Panel shall be binding upon the Employer, the Lodge and the Officer. 
The Lodge and the Employer acknowledge that procedural disputes which prevent the Panel from going forward with the review process set forth above may arise. The Lodge and the Employer acknowledge that it is in the best interests of all persons involved in the Psychological Review process to have these procedural disputes resolved as promptly and as fairly as possible. Once such a procedural dispute arises, the parties will have seven (7) working days to resolve the dispute. If they cannot resolve the dispute, either party may initiate the Summary Arbitration Process if the dispute involves the timeliness of the grievance or the period of time which the Panel is to consider when determining when the Officer became fit. Any other procedural dispute may be submitted to the Summary Arbitration process only by mutual agreement of the parties. The Lodge and the Employer will maintain a group of three (3) arbitrators for the Summary Arbitration Process. One arbitrator will be selected from this group to decide the dispute. The parties will share equally the cost of the arbitrator. At the earliest possible time, representatives of the Lodge and the Employer will appear before the arbitrator. Either party may call witnesses, provided notice is given to the other party before the hearing date is selected. No written briefs will be permitted. No court reporter will be allowed. The arbitrator will issue a decision within ten (10) working days following the hearing. The decision of the arbitrator will be binding on the Lodge, the Employer, and the members of the review Panel. The decision will not set a binding precedent on subsequent procedural disputes. 
Section 9.5 — Medical Grievances 
Grievances concerning medical issues (excluding issues covered under Section 9.4) shall follow the procedure below. Medical issues are defined as grievances involving medical issues, including but not limited to the nonpayment of I.O.D. bills; removal of an Officer from duty for medical reasons; refusal to return an Officer to duty from medical roll; classification of an injury as non-
I.O.D. and the Benefits Management Office's denial of payment of medical and hospital bills of an Officer or his or her covered dependent under the Employer's self-funded health care plan. 
Step One: Initiating a Medical Grievance. Grievances concerning the Benefits Management Office's denial of payment of medical and hospital bills will be filed with the Management and Labor Affairs Section within ten (10) working days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance or where first known by the grievant, but in no event later than thirty-five (35) calendar days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance. 
All other grievances concerning medical issues will be filed with the Medical Services Section within ten (10) working days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance or where first known by the grievant, but in no event later than thirty-five (35) calendar days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance. If the determination at Step One is not satisfactory, the Lodge may by written request made within fifteen (15) days of the Step One response, or the expiration of the period for said response submit the matter for mediation. 
Step Two: Mediation of Medical Grievances. At mediation, representatives of the Lodge, the Police Department, the Benefits Management Office and the Finance Committee of the City Council, shall participate, as needed. Any settlements reached in the mediation proceedings shall be binding upon the parties. Medical mediation sessions shall occur each thirty (30) days. The parties shall split evenly the cost of the Mediator's fees and expenses. 
The grievant shall be provided with the relevant medical records within the possession of the Medical Section, the Committee on Finance, Benefits Management Office and Management & Labor Affairs Section. A release shall be required for production of medical records. The relevant medical records shall include the Medical Services Section's determination of the grievant's status and the response to the grievance. The above records shall be submitted to the Lodge by the Department within forty-five (45) days of the Department's receipt of the Lodge's releases and mediation agenda, setting forth the grievants' names. Relevant records from the Medical Section, the Committee on Finance, the Benefits Management Office and Management and Labor Affairs Section shall be provided as stated above and throughout the grievance process until the grievance is fully resolved. 
Relevant documents to be produced by the Benefits Management Office in mediation are limited to medical records, claim forms, medical bills, explanation of benefits, and recommendation to and decision of the Benefits Committee regarding the claim. This definition of relevant records to be produced by the Benefits Management Office does not preclude the Lodge from subpoenaing additional relevant documentation in response to the scheduling of an arbitration of a grievance. 
Step Three: Arbitration. If the grievance is not resolved at Step Two, the Lodge upon written request within thirty (30) days of the date of mediation, may demand arbitration. The Mediator shall not be selected as the Arbitrator for the same case. The arbitration hearing shall be scheduled to commence within thirty (30) days of the selection of the Arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise. Within ten (10) days of the Lodge's demand for arbitration, the Employer and Lodge shall attempt to mutually agree upon an Arbitrator. If they fail to agree, a list of seven qualified neutrals shall be requested from the American Arbitration Association. Within five (5) days after receipt of the list, the parties shall select an Arbitrator. Both the Employer and the Lodge shall alternately strike names from the list. The remaining person shall be the Arbitrator. 
Section 9.6 — Suspension Grievances Grievances challenging reprimands and recommendations for suspension (excluding Summary Punishment except as specified in Section 7.2 and suspensions accompanied by a recommendation for separation) will comply with the following procedures: 
A. Reprimands and Suspensions from One (1) to Ten (10) Days 
Officers who receive a reprimand or a recommendation for suspension from one (1) to ten (10) days as a result of a sustained Complaint Register investigation (CR#) shall have one of two (2) options. Within ten (10) working days of receiving the reprimand or recommendation for discipline, the Officer shall elect one of the following options: 
1. Submission of a grievance to the Summary Opinion process challenging the reprimand or recommendation for discipline. An Arbitrator designated by the parties shall issue a Summary Opinion, in accordance with the standard procedures employed by the parties and their mutual past practices, which shall be final and binding on the parties and there shall be no further review of the reprimand or suspension under this Agreement. The Officer will not be required to serve the recommended suspension, nor will the reprimand or suspension be entered on the Officer’s disciplinary record, until the Summary Opinion Arbitrator rules on the merits of the grievance. At least ten (10) days prior to the Summary Opinion hearing, the Officer, or the Lodge acting on his or her behalf, may submit a written statement of no more than three (3) pages in length, setting forth the position of the Officer and the reasons why the Officer believes the reprimand should be set aside or the suspension should be set aside or reduced, to which the Department may submit a rebuttal of not more than two (2) pages. In addition, the Officer, provided he or she previously submitted the written statement referenced in the preceding paragraph, may appear in person before the Summary Opinion Arbitrator and make an oral presentation, of no more than fifteen (15) minutes in length, setting forth the reasons why the suspension should be set aside or reduced. The Department representative, in turn, shall have the option of presenting an oral rebuttal. For good cause shown, either party may be granted leave by the Summary Opinion Arbitrator to submit a written rebuttal within ten (10) days.

In the event the Officer elects review of the recommendation for suspension by the Police Board, the Officer will not be required to serve the recommended suspension, nor will the suspension be entered on the Officer’s disciplinary record, until the Police Board rules on the merits of the recommended suspension. 
Arbitration of suspension grievances pursuant to this Paragraph B shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Appendix Q. 
C. Suspensions from Thirty-One (31) to Three Hundred Sixty-Five (365) Days 
Officers who receive a recommendation for discipline from thirty-one (31) to three hundred sixty-five (365) days as a result of a sustained CR# shall have one of three options, the selection of which shall preclude the Officer, or the Lodge acting on his or her behalf, from selecting any of the other options listed below, except that the Officer is permitted 
to accept the recommendation at any time. Within ten (10) working days of receiving the recommendation for discipline the Officer(s) shall elect one of the following options:

Section 9.7 —Authority of the Arbitrator 
A. Except as specified in Subsection C below, the Arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, disregard, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The Arbitrator shall only consider and make a decision with respect to the specific issue or issues presented to the Arbitrator and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issues not so submitted. The Arbitrator shall submit in writing his or her decision to the Employer and to the Lodge within thirty (30) days following the close of hearing unless the parties agree to an extension thereof. The decision shall be based upon the Arbitrator's interpretation of the meaning or application of the terms of this Agreement to the facts of the grievance presented, and shall be final and binding upon the parties. 
B. In the case of a sustained finding that is subject to the parties' grievance procedure, the Arbitrator has the authority to review whether IPRA or IAD made a good faith effort to secure an affidavit from the complainant and whether the affidavit of the head of IPRA or IAD was based upon objective evidence of the type specified in Appendix L, in addition to the issues of just cause and the appropriateness of the penalty in determining whether to grant the grievance. 
C. Any Officer who is a member of and adheres to the established and traditional tenets or teachings of a bona fide religion, body or sect which has historically held conscientious objections to financially supporting organizations such as the Lodge, upon proof thereof, may be excused from the obligations set forth in Section 3.1 Article 3; and the Arbitrator may require, in lieu of such obligations, the payment by such Officer of a sum equal to the fair share agency fee to a non-religious charitable fund exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 chosen by such Officer from a list of at least three such funds to be submitted by the Lodge. The Employer shall not participate in but shall be bound by such an arbitration. 
If an Officer who holds conscientious objections pursuant to this section requests the Lodge to use the grievance-arbitration procedure on the Officer's behalf, the Lodge may charge the Officer the reasonable costs of using the procedure. 
Section 9.8 — Expense of the Arbitrator 
The fee and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne by the party whose position is not sustained by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator in the event of a decision not wholly sustaining the position of either party, shall determine the appropriate allocation of his or her fees and expenses. Each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representative(s) and witness(es). The cost of a transcript, where requested by either party, shall be paid by the party so requesting it. 
The party requesting a cancellation, rescheduling or other postponement of a set hearing date shall pay the Arbitrator's cancellation fee. 
Section 9.9 — Processing and Time Limits 
The resolution of a grievance satisfactory to the Lodge at any step shall be deemed a final settlement, and any grievance not initiated or taken to the next step within the time limit specified herein will be considered settled on the basis of the last answer by management. The time limits specified in this Article may be extended or waived by mutual agreement. Grievances may be initiated at any appropriate step corresponding with the nature of the grievance and the manner in which it arose. 
Section 9.10 — Normal Operation 
Grievance meetings shall be scheduled at reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the Employer's operations. Reasonable duty time shall be allowed the grievant Officer(s) and the watch representative or unit representative under this Article, for the pre­arbitral steps under Section 9.2. 
Section 9.11 — Exhaustion 
It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that the procedures set forth in this Article shall be mandatory as to any grievance unless expressly and specifically excluded by the terms of this Agreement. 
Section 9.12 – Lodge Rights 
This Agreement does not create or convey to any member of the bargaining unit a right to determine whether any grievance shall be advanced to arbitration. The right to evaluate any grievance and determine whether that grievance is withdrawn, settled or advanced to any form of arbitration remains solely the right of the Lodge. In the event the Lodge determines it will not advance any grievance(s) to arbitration, the Officer(s) who filed the grievance(s) will be afforded the existing procedures for the review and/or challenge of reprimands or recommendations of discipline, to the extent provided for herein.

An Officer who runs for political office may, but need not, take a leave of absence; provided that if the Officer does not choose to take a leave of absence, he or she shall first fully exhaust all accumulated paid time off and any time off thereafter shall be subject to meeting the operational needs of the Chicago Police Department. 
Section 10.4 — Religious Holiday Accommodation 
The obligation to accommodate the religious beliefs of Officers covered by the Agreement is fulfilled if those Officers whose religious beliefs require that they not work but who are scheduled to work on a recognized religious holiday are permitted at the Officer's option one of the following choices in order to be excused from their regular tour of duty: (a) the use of a personal day; (b) the use of compensatory time; (c) voluntary change of regular day off (as permitted in Section 20.3 of the Agreement); or (d) excused from duty non-disciplinary (Code 89). This option may be applied for certain recognized religious holidays of faiths whose tenets require abstinence from work subject to the determination of the Commanding Officer that this accommodation does not unduly interfere with operational needs. 
Section 10.5 —Americans with Disabilities Act 
In the event the Employer shall be required to make reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act to the disability of an applicant or incumbent Officer that may be in conflict with the right of an Officer under this Agreement, the Employer shall bring this matter to the attention of the Lodge. In the event the parties cannot reach an agreement on such accommodation, the provisions of Article 9 shall be available and the Arbitrator shall consider the Employer's and the Lodge's (if any exists) obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and this Agreement, provided that no Officer shall be displaced by such decision.

The Employer will provide the Lodge the names of all Officers to be laid off prior to the layoff. Probationary officers shall be laid off first, then Officers shall be laid off in accordance with their seniority. The Officers with the least amount of seniority in the Police Department shall be laid off first, unless special qualifications dictate retention. All Officers shall receive notice in writing of the layoff at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of such layoffs. 
Section 13.2 — Hiring During Layoffs 
No employees may be hired to perform or permitted to perform those duties normally performed by an Officer while any Officer is in layoff status.

The Committee shall meet at least once each calendar quarter or more frequently by mutual agreement. Formal recommendations of the Committee shall be submitted in writing to the Superintendent of Police with a copy to the Lodge, but such recommendations shall not be binding upon the Employer or the Lodge. In addition to Committee recommendations, the Lodge may submit additional written recommendations to the Superintendent. 
For purposes of this section, the term "investigating" shall be limited to the right of the Lodge Committee members to obtain information upon request and observe conditions regarding identified safety and health hazards and to discuss such matters with Officers and members of management provided such discussions do not unduly interfere with the performance of duty by any Officer or Committee member. 
In the event the Employer agrees in writing to adopt the recommendation of the Committee or the Lodge, the recommendation shall be implemented within a reasonable period of time, unless the failure to implement in a timely fashion was beyond the reasonable control of the Employer. However, no monetary relief shall result from the failure to implement any such recommendation. 
If the Superintendent disagrees with the recommendation of the Committee or the Lodge, he or she shall so notify the Committee or the Lodge in writing. Within ten (10) calendar days of such notice, the Lodge may request arbitration of any such dispute if such dispute raises a good faith issue regarding the use of equipment or materials which are alleged to present a serious risk to the health or safety of an Officer beyond that which is inherent in the normal performance of police duties. The decision of the Arbitrator under this section shall be advisory only and shall not be binding upon the Employer; provided that this procedure shall not be exclusive and shall not affect the right of an Officer or the Lodge to invoke Article 9, where otherwise appropriate. No such advisory opinion shall constitute a determination of the existence of any safety or health hazard under this Agreement, nor shall any such advisory opinion be introduced in any proceeding under Article 9 of this Agreement. 
Section 15.3 — Disabling Defects 
No employee shall be required to use any equipment that has been designated by both the Lodge and the Employer as being defective because of a disabling condition unless the disabling condition has been corrected.

3. 
An Officer will be suspended from working a special employment assignment for a period of ninety (90) calendar days if the Officer was scheduled for a special employment assignment and failed to work such assignment without advance notice to the Employer of his or her absence (i.e., a "no call/no show").

Pending the final determination of benefits by the Policemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund, Officers covered by this Agreement who apply for duty, ordinary or occupational disability benefits will be required to contribute the same amount as active Officers for health care benefits; and the Employer will continue to provide the same health care benefits. 
Officers who receive duty or occupational disability benefits will continue to receive those benefits at no cost without any refund of their previous contributions. Officers who are awarded ordinary disability benefits will be required to contribute at the Public Health Services Act (PHSA) rate reduced by the administrative fee of 2%, as of the first day of the month following the Fund's final determination of the Officer's claim. 
The Employer agrees to pay all hospital, medical and prescription costs of an Officer who is on a leave of absence for duty or occupational disability purposes, all at no cost to the employee. The Employer shall make pension contributions on behalf of the employee as if the employee had remained in active service. 
Section 18.10 — Medical Benefit Statement 
Upon the written request of an Officer who is injured or becomes ill in the performance of his or her duties, the Employer will provide a written statement showing the period of absence and the amount of salary received during the period of absence due to such injury or illness. Upon the written request of an Officer on a leave of absence for ordinary, occupational or duty disability pension, the Employer will provide a statement covering the period of absence prior to retirement and the amount of the disability benefit received by the Officer during said period. 
Any statements for any calendar year required of the Employer under this Section will be provided only once. 
ARTICLE 19 — BEREAVEMENT LEAVE  
Section 19.1 — Death in Family 
The Employer agrees to provide to Officers leave without loss of pay, not to exceed three (3) consecutive days any time within the seven (7) calendar days immediately following the death of a member of the immediate family, except for the death of a brother-in-law or sister-in-law which shall be for the day of the funeral only. 
Annual and time-due furlough will not be extended as a result of death occurring in the Officer's immediate family during such furlough unless the death occurs during the last three (3) days of the furlough period, at which time the procedure outlined above will be followed. 
Section 19.2 — Definition of Family 
A member of the immediate family shall be defined to be any Officer's mother or father (including step), spouse, domestic partner, daughter or son (including step or adopted), sister or brother (including half or step), father-in-law, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandparent or grandchild. 
In the event of the death of a domestic partner, the employee shall be granted three (3) consecutive days of leave any time within seven (7) calendar days immediately following the death provided that the employee has registered the name of the employee's domestic partner with the Department of Personnel. 
Domestic partners are defined as two persons, regardless of their gender, who have a close personal relationship, sharing the same regular and permanent residence for at least six months, are eighteen years of age or older, not married to anyone, not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the State of Illinois, and are each other's sole domestic partner, responsible for each other's common welfare and jointly sharing their financial responsibilities. 
Section 19.3 — Extended Bereavement Leave 
Where an Officer is entitled to bereavement leave pursuant to Section 19.1 above, and where death occurs and the funeral is to be held out of Illinois and beyond the states contiguous thereto, the Officer shall be entitled to a maximum of five consecutive days. For purposes of this Section, those states contiguous to the State of Illinois are: Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Kentucky and Michigan. 
ARTICLE 20 — HOURS AND OVERTIME

Section 20.2 — Compensation for Overtime 
All approved overtime in excess of the hours required of an Officer by reason of the Officer's regular duty, whether of an emergency nature or of a non-emergency nature, shall be compensated for at the rate of time-and-one-half. Such time shall be computed on the basis of completed fifteen (15)-minute segments. 
An Officer who earns overtime pursuant to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) shall be paid overtime compensation at the FLSA rate agreed upon by the parties. An Officer who earns non-FLSA overtime shall have the option of electing pay or compensatory time consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. 
Section 20.3 — Sixth and Seventh Day Work 
An Officer who is in pay status for six (6) or seven (7) consecutive days within the pay period Sunday through Saturday will be compensated at the rate of time-and-one-half for work performed on the sixth (6th) day and seventh (7th) day. An Officer who performs work on a regular day off which has been cancelled, will receive a minimum of eight (8) hours compensation or compensation at the rate of time-and-one-half times the actual hours worked, whichever is greater. Voluntary schedule changes will be exempt from this provision. 
Section 20.4 — Call-Back 
A call-back is defined as an official assignment of work which does not continuously precede or continuously follow an Officer's regularly-scheduled working hours. Officers who are directed to report to any of the Employer's premises or other specified location or are authorized to attend a beat meeting at a specified time on a regular scheduled work day or required to report to the Medical Section or are authorized to attend a beat meeting at a specified time on the Officer's regular day off, shall be compensated for two (2) hours at the appropriate overtime rate or be compensated for the actual time worked, whichever is greater, at the overtime rate. 
Section 20.5 — Court Time 
Officers required to attend court outside their regularly scheduled work hours shall be compensated at the overtime rate with a minimum of two (2) hours, except (1) if the court time is during the Officer's compensatory time and the Officer knew of the court date before his or her request for compensatory time was approved, (2) while the Officer is on paid medical leave, or (3) if the Officer is compensated for such time by a secondary employer. 
Officers required to attend authorized court or authorized pretrial conferences within one (1) hour immediately preceding their normal tour of duty will be compensated at the overtime rate for one 
(1) hour. Officers required to attend authorized court or authorized pretrial conferences commencing during their tour of duty and extending beyond the normal end of the tour of duty will be compensated at the overtime rate on the basis of completed fifteen (15)-minute segments. This overtime will be computed from the end of the normal tour of duty to the sign-out time at court or at conclusion of the pretrial conference. 
Court appearances during off-duty hours will be credited at the rate of time-and-one-half with a minimum of two (2) hours when the actual time spent in court is two (2) hours or less. When the actual time spent in court exceeds two (2) hours, overtime will be computed on the basis of completed fifteen (15)-minute segments. Appearances at more than one court on the same day will be computed at the rate of time-and-one-half in the following manner:

Section 20.7 — Change of Schedule The Employer's right to assign Officers for duty at any time and at different times during each twenty-eight (28)-day police period remains unrestricted and unchallenged. Watch assignments and designated starting times shall be established and posted for each police period. Watch assignments and designated starting times shall remain in effect for the duration of the twenty-eight (28)-day police period, except for: 
A. in-service training (including individualized training) with a maximum of six 
(6)
programs per year for a maximum of eighteen (18) days per year and with seven (7) days' notice to the Officer; or 

B. 
elective training (elective training are job-related programs the Department makes available to Officers and in which the Officer elects to participate); or 

C. 
mandatory proficiency training for employees receiving D-2 or D-2A pay or otherwise receiving specialist or premium pay because of the position or assignment held, with a maximum of six (6) programs per year, for a maximum of thirty (30) days per year and with seven (7) days' notice to the Officer; or 

D. 
pre-service training for promotions; or 

E. 
court appearances in excess of two (2) consecutive days; or 

F. 
initial assignment when detailed to the Alternate Response Section. 


However, starting times may be adjusted by the Employer: (1) plus or minus two (2) hours from the designated starting times; or (2) for up to seven (7) hours within an Officer's assigned watch for circumstances not known to the Department 48 hours prior to the start of the police period. Provided that where an Officer who has been scheduled to attend in-service training and does not attend because of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Employer, the Employer may reschedule said Officer for said in-service training without payment of premium time hereunder. 
Any adjustment inconsistent with the above provision, made after the start of the twenty-eight (28)-day police period, will result in payment in accordance with Section 20.2 for the hours worked outside of the Officer's tour of duty scheduled at the beginning of the Officer's twenty-eight (28)-day police period for that period. Shift changes during a police period made voluntarily at the request of an Officer and upon approval of the Employer shall not require additional compensation. 
This Section does not apply in the following situations: 
A. The Superintendent and the Mayor have determined in writing that a serious emergency condition exists; 
B. When Officers are assigned to duties that by their very nature require changes in starting times, including personnel assigned to the following Offices, Bureaus, Divisions or Units:

9. 
No more than two (2) members of the immediate staff of each exempt Commanding Officer. 


Section 20.8 — Stand-By 
Where the Employer requires an Officer to remain on standby, available for work, and the Officer is not able to come and go as he or she pleases, such time shall be paid as time worked. 
Section 20.9 — Day-Off Change 
Days off assigned on "change day" shall remain unchanged for the duration of each 28-day police period except for: 
A. in-service training (including individualized training) with a maximum of seven (7) programs per year for a maximum of twenty-eight (28) days per year and with seven (7) days' notice to the Officer; or 
B. elective training (elective training are job-related programs the Department makes available to Officers and in which the Officer elects to participate); or

D. pre-service training for promotions. 
The Employer's right to assign Officers for duty while on regular day-off status is unrestricted and unchallenged. The Employer agrees, however, that in each such event it will pay the Officer so assigned the optional premium time under Article 20 of the Agreement. No such optional premium time shall be paid, however, for Officers assigned to School Patrol Unit for any change occurring during any police period which includes the start of the school year, or the end of the school year nor shall any such optional premium time be paid for in-service training program, with a maximum of three programs per year, for a maximum of nine days per year, provided the Officer is given seven (7) days' notice of such change, and pre-service training for promotion, provided, that where an Officer who has been scheduled to attend in-service training does not attend for any reason beyond the reasonable control of the Employer, the Employer may reschedule said Officer for said in-service training without payment of premium time hereunder. 
Day off changes made voluntarily at the request of an Officer, and upon approval of the Employer, shall not require premium pay pursuant to Section 20.3. Changes required to implement the provisions of Section 23.2 controlling scheduled days off for members of the bargaining unit going on or returning from furlough, also shall not require premium compensation. 
The Lodge acknowledges that willingness to restrict summer furlough and days off on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays and accept varied days off each week are conditions of assignment among Mounted Patrol Unit Officers covered by the collective bargaining agreement. 
The mounted unit is a recognized exception to this Section, and a change of regular day-off status for personnel assigned to the mounted unit may be made on a day other than "change day" without payment of premium time under Article 20 of the Agreement, provided that affected personnel shall receive at least ten (10) days' notice of such change. 
Those Officers assigned to events known as the Taste of Chicago, Mexican Independence Festival and Puerto Rican Independence Festival shall not have their day-off group changed for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime pay. In the event that days off must be canceled to supplement the personnel assigned to said events, the opportunity to earn overtime pay will first be offered to the Officers assigned to said events. If there are not sufficient volunteers, said overtime pay opportunities will be offered to Officers who are in regular day-off status in the District where the event occurs. In the event the City permits an event known as Octoberfest, said event shall be added to the three above listed events. 
Section 20.10 — Day-Off Group Assignment 
In the event the Employer determines to change an Officer's day-off group assignment, the Employer shall seek volunteers to satisfy its needs; provided, however, (1) if there are more volunteers than required, the volunteers with the greatest seniority on the watch in the day-off group affected shall be changed, and (2) if there are not sufficient volunteers, the Officers with the lowest seniority on the watch in the day-off group affected shall be changed; provided further, said Officers meet the Employer's needs. 
Section 20.11 — Accumulation of Compensatory Time 
The Employer will not restrict an accumulation of compensatory time except as provided in Section 
20.2. The number of hours of compensatory time which an Officer has on record shall not be the controlling factor in determining whether an Officer will be allowed to take time due. 
Section 20.12 — Back to Back Shifts on Change Day 
An Officer shall normally not be required to work more than four hours on the first watch on change day if he or she has worked a full tour of duty on the third watch on the proceeding day. If he or she is required to work more than four hours on a change day on the first watch, he or she shall be paid at the rate of time-and-one-half for the hours worked on the first watch on change day. 
Section 20.13 — Duty Availability Allowance 
A. Effective on each of the following effective dates, all Officers shall be paid the following quarterly amounts:
 Effective Date Per Quarter January 1, 2012 $805.00 
January 1, 2014 $855.00 
January 1, 2016 $870.00 
January 1, 2017 $900.00 
B. In accord with applicable law, the Employer shall treat duty availability allowance payments as pensionable. 
C. Entitlement to duty availability pay is not dependent on an Officer being present for duty for an entire pay period. 
D. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in (A) above, Officers hired on or after January 1, 2015, shall receive duty availability pay commencing at Step 5 (after 42 months) of the Salary Schedule.

The Employer shall pay for the first issue of any change in, or modification of, the prescribed uniform announced and effective after November 15, 1981. 
Section 21.5 — Uniform Option 
Subject to seasonal uniform requirements, the prescribed dress uniform may be worn at any time at the Officer's option. The current optional winter leather jacket is reclassified as an alternative to the prescribed long cloth coat, but an Officer shall not be required to own both. When performing administrative/clerical duties inside a facility, the prescribed uniform short sleeved shirt may be worn irrespective of seasonal uniform requirements. 
Section 21.6 — Lost Shields 
In cases where discipline is warranted, the maximum suspension for the first offense of loss of shield shall be one-half day to be implemented by reducing the Officer's compensatory time by four (4) hours or one actual one-half day suspension without pay if the Officer does not have available compensatory time.

The seniority of an Officer retained beyond the eighteen (18) month probationary period shall date back to the last date of hire as a police Officer and be subject to the deductions provided in subsection B. 
In the event two or more Officers have the same seniority date, the older Officer, as determined by referring to the Officers' date of birth as recorded on their employment application, shall receive the higher seniority status. 
There shall be only one seniority for Officers covered by this Agreement and that seniority shall control for the purpose of determining rights, benefits, and other conditions of employment affected by seniority under this Agreement. 
B. All absence from the Department's service without pay as a result of leaves for more than thirty 
(30)
 days (other than military, duty, occupational or ordinary disability), suspensions of more than thirty (30) days and all unexcused absences shall be deducted in computing continuous length of service for purposes of determining advancement within the salary schedule, amount of furlough, and seniority for other purposes covered by this Agreement.

1. 
Resignation; 

2.

7. 
Laid off for a period of time as set forth in the City of Chicago Personnel Rules             as in effect on December 31, 1983. 


Section 23.2 — Furlough Scheduling 
An Officer shall select his or her furlough within the unit of assignment, or if detailed for 28 days or more prior to the date selection begins, within the unit of detail on the basis of seniority among the Officers on the Officer’s assigned watch. Officers may elect to take their full furlough or split the furlough to which they are entitled into two equal segments. Both furloughs, if split, shall be determined in one process and on the basis of seniority. A full furlough will commence on the 1st day of a police period. A split furlough will commence on either the 1st or 15th day of a police period. 
Compensatory time furloughs will not be scheduled for Officers who split their annual furloughs; however, such Officers shall be allowed to take a compensatory time furlough by utilizing elective days between regularly-scheduled weekends off, subject to manpower requirements. 
Furlough schedules may be adjusted to accommodate seasonal operations, significant revision in organization, work assignments or the number of personnel in particular ranks. 
The day-off group of an Officer on furlough (full or split) will not be changed during the remainder of the week in which the Officer is scheduled to return, unless an Officer who is required to work on his or her scheduled day(s) off during that week is compensated by the payment of premium benefits under Article 20 for all hours worked on his or her scheduled day off. 
Officers who elect to either split their annual furloughs into two segments or take a full annual furlough will be returned to the day-off group they were in at the time their furlough or furlough segments were selected. Affected Officers will notify their unit commanding officer two (2) weeks prior to the beginning of the furlough segment if their day-off group must be changed to match the original group. The change in day-off group should take place on the Sunday preceding the first day of the furlough segment. 
Section 23.3 — Promotion 
Seniority shall be considered in the promotion of Officers covered by this Agreement. In considering Officers for promotion, seniority shall, in competitive testing, be utilized as a tie­breaker. 
Section 23.4 — Seniority List 
The Employer shall prepare a seniority list. The list shall be made available to Officers in each unit and to the Lodge on the Department’s computerized database, in a format that may be sorted in seniority and/or alphabetical order.  
Section 23.5 — Priority Schedule for Use of Elective Time 
Any dispute within a unit as to the selection of a personal day provided for in Section 11.3 shall be resolved by seniority. 
Elective time used for an authorized furlough extension as defined in Section 29.A.4 shall receive first priority provided that a written request is submitted at least fourteen (14) days prior to the beginning of a furlough or furlough segment. 
Section 23.6 — Overtime for Pre-Planned Events 
The following procedures will apply in case of events which will require the cancellation of days 
off and for which the Department has received a minimum of 21 days' prior notice. In those units which have been designated to provide personnel, seniority will be the dominant factor in the selection of Officers required to work their regular days off, provided that the Officer to be selected possesses the necessary skill or special qualifications to perform the duties required. The Employer shall seek volunteers on the basis of seniority from among those qualified Officers in said unit. If there are insufficient qualified volunteers, the Employer shall select Officers on the basis of reverse seniority, provided that the Employer may assign probationary officers without regard to seniority. 
The Employer will post a notice of such events in the CO book and Officers desiring to exercise the option to work will notify their unit commanding officer within seven days of the date the notice was posted. 
For the purpose of pre-planned overtime assignments, a unit may be defined as a bureau, division, 
district, watch, tactical team, etc. For duty on election or primary days, seniority will be the dominant factor in the selection of Officers required to work their regular day off in the polling place. Those Officers who work overtime will be compensated in accordance with Sections 20.1 and 20.2. For purposes of this paragraph, Officers in tactical teams on their regular day off shall be treated the same as other Officers on the same watch in the same district, subject to operational needs. 
For purposes of this paragraph, the Employer will select Officers to work a four- (4) hour extended tour of duty on election or primary days on the basis of seniority from among those qualified Officers working the affected watch who volunteer for the extended tour. If and to the extent that there are insufficient volunteers, the Employer shall select Officers from the affected watch on the basis of reverse seniority. 
Section 23.7 — Holiday Assignment When operational considerations require that some Officers of a unit work on a holiday, as defined in Section 11.1 of this Agreement, the most senior Officers will be given the option to work, provided that the holiday is not an Officer's regular day off or a part of an Officer's approved furlough extension and that the Officer possesses the necessary skill or special qualifications to perform the duties required. When operational considerations require limitations on the number of Officers who may be given the holiday as a day off, the most senior Officer(s) will be given the option to take the holiday as a day off, provided the request is submitted seven (7) days before the holiday. 
For the purpose of holiday assignments, a unit may be defined as bureau, division, section, group, watch, district, etc. 
Section 23.8 — Filling Recognized Vacancies 
This Section shall apply only to the Public Transportation Section including the Public Transportation Canine Unit, Public Housing Sections North and South, the Special Activity Section, Traffic Section/Detail Unit, Traffic Enforcement Unit, Traffic Court/Records Unit, Traffic Safety & Training Unit, Major Accident Investigation Unit, Loop Traffic, District Law Enforcement, Airport Law Enforcement North and South, Mounted Unit, Marine Unit, Gun Registration Section, Records Inquiry Section, Field Inquiry Section, Evidence & Recovered Property Section, Police Document Services Section, Central Detention Section, Auto Pound Section (D-1 Officers), Electronics and Motor Maintenance Division (D-1 Officers), Office of Emergency Communications (excluding the Alternate Response Section), Area Criminal Investigations, Missing Persons Section, Juvenile Court Liaison Section, Youth Investigation Group Areas (excluding Youth Investigation Group Special Investigation Unit and Youth Investigation Group Administration), Auto Theft Section, Bomb and Arson Section (except bomb technicians), excluding the immediate staff of each exempt commanding officer not to exceed two (2) staff members. 
A vacancy for purposes of this Section ("recognized vacancy") exists when an Officer is transferred, resigns, retires, dies, is discharged, when there are new units created, or when the Department increases the number of employees in a unit, except for details for not more than three 
(3) months and the Summer Lakefront Bike Detail. The Employer shall determine at any time before said vacancy is filled whether or not a recognized vacancy shall be filled. If and when the Employer determines to fill a recognized vacancy, this Section shall apply. 
In order to avoid the inefficiency of chain-effect bidding, the vacancy created by the reassignment of a successful bidder shall be a recognized vacancy herein; however, subsequent vacancies created thereby shall be filled within the Department's discretion. Further, there is no recognized vacancy created as a result of emergencies, or when an Officer is removed for disciplinary reasons for up to 30 days. When an Officer is removed for disciplinary reasons for more than 30 days, a recognized vacancy is created. 
The Employer shall post a list of recognized vacancies, if any, stating the requirements needed to fill the opening, at least 14 days before the start of the 28-day police period. A copy of such postings shall be given to the Lodge. Non-probationary Officers within the same D-1 salary grade or D-2 job classification, within 72 hours of the time the list has been posted, may bid on a recognized vacancy in writing on a form to be supplied by the Employer. One copy of the bid shall be presented to the Employer; one copy shall be forwarded to the Lodge; and one copy shall be retained by the Officer. Bidding under this Section 23.8 may only be for a recognized vacancy in a specific unit without regard to shift, day off, unit duty assignments, etc. The Employer shall respond to the successful bidder and the Lodge no later than 3 days prior to the change day for the new 28-day police period. During the bidding and selection process, the Employer may temporarily fill a recognized vacancy by assigning an Officer to said vacancy until the recognized vacancy is filled. 
An eligible bidder shall be an Officer who is able to perform in the recognized vacancy to the satisfaction of the Employer after orientation without further training. The Employer shall select the most senior qualified bidder when the qualifications of the Officers involved are equal. In determining qualifications, the Employer shall not be arbitrary or capricious, but shall consider training, education, experience, skills, ability, demeanor and performance, except that the parties recognize that the unique operational needs of the Employer require flexibility in the delivery of public service and to meet this need the Employer may fill 20% of the recognized vacancies within its discretion, provided that, if the Employer does not utilize any or all of its 20% exception in any personnel order, the remainder of the unused exception may be carried forward and used to fill future recognized vacancies within a twelve (12)-month period. 
An exception to the above paragraph will apply to Airport Law Enforcement North and South, and the Traffic Section/ Detail Unit, fifty percent (50%) of all recognized vacancies in each of these units shall be filled by bid. 
Bidding procedures will be done in conformance with the Memorandum of Understanding in this Agreement. The successful bidder may not bid for another recognized vacancy for one (1) year unless reassigned by the Employer during that year. A successful bidder may not be reassigned except for (1) emergencies for the duration of the emergency, (2) for just cause or (3) where the Superintendent determines that the Officer's continued assignment would interfere with the Officer's effectiveness in that assignment. When there are no qualified bidders, the Employer may fill the recognized vacancy within its discretion. 
Section 23.9 — Filling Unit Duty Assignments 
This Section shall apply only to the following jobs within the units set forth in Section 23.8: Warrant Clerk, Summary Investigation Detective, Review Investigation Detective, Review Officers, Detective Division Administrative Desk Duty Assignment, District Desk, District Watch Relief, or Lockup only as specifically set forth below. The Employer agrees not to eliminate any Unit Duty Assignments listed in this Section for the duration of this Agreement. 
An opening in a unit duty assignment for purposes of this Section ("recognized opening") exists when an Officer performing the above unit duty assignments is to be transferred, resigns, retires, dies, is discharged, when there are new unit duty assignments created, or when the Department increases the number of employees in a unit, except for details for not more than three (3) months. A recognized opening will be created when an Officer is voluntarily detailed and remains absent from his or her Unit duty assignment for more than three (3) months. An Officer's assignment to a detail shall not be rolled over solely for the purpose of avoiding the effect of this Section. The Employer shall determine at any time before said opening is filled whether or not a recognized opening shall be filled. If the Employer decides to fill a recognized opening utilizing Section 18.4, the Employer must provide the Lodge with the name of the limited duty Officer within ten (10) days of filling the recognized opening. If and when the Employer determines to fill a recognized opening other than utilizing Section 18.4, this Section shall apply. Further, there is no recognized opening created as a result of emergencies, or when an Officer is removed for disciplinary reasons for up to thirty (30) days. When an Officer is removed for disciplinary reasons for more than thirty (30) days or when an Officer is relieved of his or her police powers for more than ninety 
(90) days for reasons other than placement on the medical roll, a recognized opening is created. 
In the event a recognized opening is to be bid under this Section, the Employer shall post within the unit on the first Wednesday of the next police period a list of recognized openings therein, if any, stating the requirements needed to fill the opening. This list will remain posted for seven (7) calendar days. A copy of such postings shall be given to the Lodge at the time of the bid posting. Non-probationary Officers within the same unit and within the same D-1, D-2 or D-2A job classification, may bid on a recognized opening in writing on a form to be supplied by the Employer. One copy of the bid shall be presented to the Employer, one copy shall be forwarded to the Lodge, and one copy shall be retained by the Officer. The Employer shall respond to the successful bidder and the Lodge no later than three (3) days prior to the change day for the new 28-day police period. During the bidding and selection process, the Employer may temporarily fill a recognized opening by assigning an officer to said opening until the recognized opening is filled by bid; however, the Employer may not assign Officers to a vacated position to avoid bidding the recognized opening. 
An eligible bidder shall be an Officer who is able to perform in the recognized opening to the satisfaction of the Employer after orientation. The Employer shall select the most senior qualified bidder when the qualifications of the Officers involved are equal. In determining qualifications, the Employer shall not be arbitrary or capricious, but shall consider training, education, experience, skills, ability, demeanor and performance. 
The successful bidder may not bid for another recognized unit duty assignment opening for one 
(1) police period year. A successful bidder may not be reassigned except for (1) emergencies for the duration of the emergency, (2) for just cause, (3) where the Superintendent determines that the Officer's continued assignment would interfere with the Officer's effectiveness in that assignment, or (4) temporary unit duty assignments for operational needs, provided the Employer shall not fill the vacated unit duty assignment. When there are no qualified bidders, the Employer may fill the recognized opening within its discretion. Unit duty assignments in District Desk, District Watch Relief, or Lock-up shall be treated in accordance with this Section 23.9 in all respects except the following: (1) only non-probationary Officers within the same watch and within the same D-1 salary grade shall be eligible to bid for recognized openings in such assignments. 
The District Watch Secretary position may be filled at the Employer's discretion. These positions are limited to one (1) position per watch in each district. If the Employer decides to fill the District Watch Secretary position, the daily unit duty assignment sheets will identify the Officer assigned to the District Watch Secretary position. The duties and responsibilities of the District Watch Secretary are to be determined by the Employer provided that the lockup, review and the desk Officer bid positions as set forth in the Agreement shall be filled by either the bid Officer or District Watch Relief personnel prior to filling these positions with the District Watch Secretary. 
If the Employer violates this Section by improperly filling a recognized opening by not placing the opening up for bid, the affected Officer(s) will be compensated at the rate of time and one-half in quarter hour increments until the violation is remedied. The Employer is granted the ability to remedy the violation without waiting until the next police period. 
If the Employer violates this section by improperly selecting a bidder or improperly determining qualifications for a recognized opening, the affected Officer(s) will be compensated at the rate of time and one-half in quarter hour increments up to a maximum of fifty (50) hours of compensatory time. 
Section 23.10 — Non-Disciplinary Demotion 
In the event of non-disciplinary demotions for economic reasons, the Employer shall select the most junior Officer when the qualifications of the Officers involved are equal. In determining qualifications, the Employer shall not be arbitrary and capricious, but shall consider training, education, experience, skills, ability, demeanor and performance. 
Section 23.11 — Details 
Officers assigned to units designated to provide personnel to the Summer Mobile Force, Expressway Detail, Auto Snow Tow Detail, and the Winter Holiday Season Traffic Detail will be permitted to bid for this detail on the basis of seniority. If and to the extent that there are insufficient qualified bidders from a designated unit to meet that unit's allocation, the Employer will select Officers who are deemed qualified by reverse seniority from the designated unit to fill that unit's allocation. 
If the Employer decides to assign an Officer to a detail outside the area, district, or unit, to a sports event, parade, festival, or labor dispute; or to another event detail which constitutes a tour of duty, the Employer shall announce the detail at a roll call preceding the event, which roll call is for the same roll call on the same watch in the same unit from which Officers are to be assigned to the detail. If notification at roll call is not feasible or appropriate, the Employer shall determine the method of notification. The Employer shall select Officers to work the detail on the basis of seniority from among those qualified Officers on said watch who are not in bid jobs and who volunteer for the detail. If and to the extent that there are insufficient qualified volunteers, the Employer shall select Officers on the basis of reverse seniority. The Employer may assign probationary officers during their initial twelve (12) month period of probation without regard to seniority. 
When the Employer decides to assign an Officer to a detail outside the Officer's unit of assignment for more than ten (10) days to a unit listed in Section 23.8 to provide relief for a temporary manpower shortage due to furlough, medical, or suspension, the Employer shall select Officers to work the detail on the basis of seniority from among those qualified Officers who volunteer for the detail. If and to the extent that there are insufficient volunteers, the Employer shall select Officers on the basis of reverse seniority, provided that the Employer may assign probationary officers during their initial twelve (12) month period of probation without regard to seniority. 
When the Employer decides to assign an Officer to a detail outside the Officer's unit of assignment for more than thirty (30) days to a unit listed in Section 23.8 to provide relief for a temporary manpower shortage due to the actual strength being more than ten (10%) percent below authorized strength, the Employer shall select Officers to work the detail on the basis of seniority from among those qualified Officers who volunteer for the detail. If and to the extent that there are insufficient volunteers, the Employer shall select Officers on the basis of reverse seniority, provided that the Employer may assign probationary officers during their initial twelve (12) month period of probation without regard to seniority. 
The Employer's right to assign Tactical Teams, Mission Teams, District Gang Tactical Teams, or other specialized units shall not be restricted in any way by this Section. In emergency situations, or situations where the Employer reasonably anticipates civil disorder will occur, or does occur, this Section shall not apply. 
For purposes of bidding, the Employer may disregard seniority if and to the extent necessary to achieve the balance of experience and qualifications the Employer determines to be desirable in the detail and unit involved. 
For purposes of selecting Officers on the basis of reverse seniority, the Employer may retain a junior Officer if and to the extent necessary to fulfill operational needs. 
If the Employer assigns an Officer to a detail or denies an Officer(s) assignment to a detail in any manner contrary to the provisions of this Agreement, the affected Officer(s) will be entitled to compensation at the rate of time and one-half in quarter hour increments for the duration of the detail. 
Any time the Employer designates a unit to provide personnel to fill any detail by reverse seniority, all Officers that have been detailed into that unit for more than ninety (90) days shall be included as though they were assigned to the unit providing the detail. 
Section 23.12 — Reassignment of Duties 
No provision in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Employer from hiring or assigning any non-bargaining unit personnel to perform any unit duties as described in Appendix B and/or C, provided that no Officer covered by this Agreement shall be laid off either as a result thereof or if his or her non-bargaining unit replacement, if any, has not been laid off. 
Any Officer who is to be displaced by a non-bargaining unit person shall be given 60 days' prior notice of said displacement. The Employer shall designate the positions and duties to which displaced Officers shall be assigned. Displaced Officers may be assigned to other job duties within the same unit without regard to Section 23.8 and 23.9. If the Employer decides to assign displaced Officers to different units, such displaced Officers shall be permitted to bid for such assignments which the Employer decides to fill with such Officers on the basis of seniority and qualifications in accordance with Section 23.8. If Officers other than those displaced are permitted by the Employer to bid for such assignments, then all the displaced Officers shall be deemed to be more senior than all of the non-displaced bidders for purposes of said bid. 
An Officer who has been given a limited duty assignment pursuant to Section 18.3 shall not be displaced from limited duty under Section 23.12 for the duration of his or her eligibility for limited duty. 
Section 23.13 —Acting Desk Sergeant

2. 
A Dispute Resolution Board shall be convened and shall be composed of three (3) persons: one appointed by the Employer, one appointed by the Lodge and one impartial member to be mutually selected and agreed upon by the Employer and the Lodge. If, after 


a period of five (5) days from the date of the appointment of the two representatives of the parties, the remaining Board member has not been selected or otherwise agreed upon, then either representative may request the American Arbitration Association, or its successor in function, to furnish a list of seven members of said service from which the remaining Board member shall be selected.

6. 
The Employer and the Lodge shall attempt to agree upon a written statement of the issue or issues to be presented to the Board. In lieu of, or in addition to, such mutual statement of issues, each party may also present its own list or statement of issues, provided only that any such issue not mutually agreed upon shall have been an issue previously the subject of negotiations or presentation at negotiations. During the course of proceedings, the Chairman of the Board shall have the authority as necessary to maintain decorum and order and may direct, (absent mutual agreement) the order of procedure; the rules of evidence or procedure in any court shall not apply or be binding. The actual proceedings shall not be open to the public and the parties understand and agree that the provisions of 5 ILCS 120/1 et seq. are not applicable.

7. 
The compensation, if any, of the representatives appointed by the Lodge shall be paid by the Lodge. The compensation of the representative appointed by the Employer shall be paid by the Employer. 

8. 
The terms decided upon by the Board shall be included in an agreement to be submitted to the City Council for adoption. The terms of this Agreement shall continue to bind both parties hereto during all negotiations and impasse resolution procedures. 

9. 
If the City Council should reject the arbitrated agreement, the parties shall meet again within ten (10) days of the Council's vote to discuss the reasons for the Council's rejection and to determine whether any modifications can be made to deal with the problems; but either party may thereafter terminate this Agreement upon ten 


(10)days' written notice to the other.

Section 30.2 — Military Leave 
Any Officer who is a member of a reserve force or a national guard of the United States or of the State of Illinois, and who is ordered by appropriate authorities to attend a training program or to perform other duties under the supervision of the United States or the State of Illinois, shall be granted paid leave of absence during the period of such activity, not to exceed fourteen (14) calendar days in any calendar year, in the case of a member of a reserve force, and not to exceed fifteen (15) calendar days in the case of the National Guard.

Effective January 1, 2005, Officers who are deployed for military service in excess of fifteen (15) calendar days in a combat zone (as designated pursuant to the Executive Orders of the President of the United States) shall not be required to reimburse the Employer the amount of military pay they receive. The Employer will continue to make its pension contributions for such Officers. 
The Employer acknowledges and agrees that in the event local, Illinois or Federal law, as such laws may be amended from time to time, mandates greater benefits than as set forth in this Section, it will apply the provisions of such law(s) to Officers.  
ARTICLE 31 — STEADY WATCH  
Section 31.1 — Implementation 
A. 1. District and units in which assigned Officers have selected a steady watch will continue to select a steady watch each year. These units include the following: District Law Enforcement Airport Law Enforcement (O'Hare and Midway) Bomb and Arson Unit Central Detention Crime Lab (including Mobile Crime Unit) Detective Division Evidence & Recovered Property Marine Unit Major Accident Investigation Mounted Unit Office of Emergency Communications (COS) 
Public Transportation (including Canine) Traffic Enforcement 
2. The Employer will not expand excluded units or assign Officers to excluded units for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this Article. 
B. It is the intention that the above units will continue on steady watch. In the event that there is a dispute as to whether a newly created unit is susceptible to steady watches, the dispute shall first be subject to procedures set forth at Section 31.7 hereof, then Section 31.8, if available, or the dispute resolution as set forth in Article 28. 
Section 31.2 —Alternate Response Section Bidding 
Officers who are detailed to the Alternate Response Section will be allowed to bid by seniority for a steady watch subject to the following provisions: 
A. Fifty percent, up to a maximum of thirty-one (31), of the most senior Officers who are in a convalescent duty status or limited duty status and have been detailed to the Alternate Response Section for a minimum of two (2) years will be allowed to bid for a steady watch. 
B. The Employer will calculate the number of eligible bidders and identify the number of positions on each watch that will be put to bid. 
C. This bidding procedure is to be done on an annual basis prior to the Annual Furlough Selection. The Filling of Vacancies provision of Section 31.5 and the Temporary Watch Assignments provision of Section 31.6 do not apply to the Alternate Response Section. Vacancies that occur after the annual bidding process will be filled at the Employer’s discretion. 
D. Successful bidders may be removed at any time from their bidded watch by the Employer if: 
1) it can be demonstrated that the Officer’s continued assignment to the watch would interfere with the Officer’s effectiveness in that assignment; 2) there are emergencies, for the duration of the emergency; or 3) there is just cause for removal. 
Section 31.3 — Exclusions 
The following Officers are not subject to the bid process for steady watch assignments: Officers voluntarily assigned as Tactical Officers, Officers voluntarily assigned to Foot Patrol in the 1st and 18th Districts, the immediate staff of each commanding officer and the District Law Enforcement Community Policing Officers (including Senior Services Officers) are not subject to the bid process for steady watch assignments. The Employer will not expand the excluded assignments or assign Officers to the excluded assignments for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this Article. 
For the purposes of this Section, the number of excluded staff positions is limited to two (2) staff members. For the purposes of this Section, the number of excluded Community Policing Officers is limited to seven (7); five (5) on the second watch and two (2) on the third watch. In the event that the staff members or Community Policing Officers are removed from that assignment, said Officers shall not be involuntarily removed from their assigned watch for the remainder of the calendar year unless they are affected by reverse seniority required movements. 
In the event that a tactical Officer is involuntarily removed from the tactical team, said Officer will be given the opportunity to submit a bid for a steady watch assignment. The Officer's bid will be honored and the Officer will be granted a bid position and be added to the watch the Officer would have been eligible to bid for if he or she would have bid during the annual selection process. 
Section 31.4 —Annual Selection Process 
Prior to the Annual Furlough Selection, steady watch assignments shall be made in the following manner: 
The Employer shall determine and post the number of positions to be assigned to each watch. Eighty (80%) percent of the positions on each watch included in this Article shall first be selected by seniority, and such seniority bid assignments shall be made before any discretionary assignments are filled by the Employer. The biddable opening on each watch shall be awarded to the most senior qualified bidder within that district or unit who has the present ability to perform all of the available duties to the reasonable satisfaction of the Employer. Any Officer performing a duty assignment anywhere in the Department shall be presumptively considered able to perform to the satisfaction of the Department. The remaining twenty (20%) percent of those positions shall be filled at the discretion of the Employer. 
Within ten (10) days of the date of the annual selection of watch assignments, the Employer shall provide the Lodge with documentation of the number of allocated personnel by watch, a list of successful bidders by watch, and a list of Officers assigned by the Department's discretionary percentage by watch. 
The annual furlough selection by seniority on the watch shall continue to be made in accordance with the historic practices and procedures of the Department. 
Section 31.5 — Filling of Vacancies 
Except for those exclusions set forth in Section 31.2 and Section 31.3 above, vacancies in steady watch assignments occurring after the Annual Selection Process shall be filled in the manner provided for in this Section. A vacancy exists when an Officer performing the assignment is permanently transferred, permanently reassigned, resigns, retires, dies, is separated, or when the Department increases the number of Officers in a unit on a specific watch. 
Vacancies shall be filled as follows: if the vacancy is a bid vacancy, i.e., the previous incumbent held the position by bid, then the vacancy shall be filled by bid. If the previous incumbent had been appointed at the discretion of the Employer, then the vacancy shall be filled at the discretion of the Employer. 
If and when the Employer decides to fill a recognized watch vacancy by bid, such vacancy to be bid shall be posted on the seventh calendar day (Wednesday) of the Third, Sixth, and Ninth Police Periods and shall remain posted for seven (7) calendar days from the day of posting. The vacancy shall be filled by the most senior qualified Officer bidding for the vacancy. If no such qualified Officer within the unit bids for such vacancy, the Employer may fill the watch vacancy by reverse seniority. Any Officer performing the duty assignment anywhere in the unit shall be presumptively considered able to perform to the satisfaction of the Employer. 
Officers who are newly assigned to a unit may be placed on a watch at the Employer's discretion until such time as the Officer accepts a management position or is able to bid on a vacancy at the next regularly-scheduled vacancy posting during the Third, Sixth, or Ninth Police Period. 
Within ten (10) days of the date of the watch vacancy filling, the Employer shall provide the Lodge with documentation of the number of vacancies filled by watch, the number of additional allocated personnel by watch, a list of successful bidders by watch, and a list of Officers assigned by the Department's discretionary percentage by watch. 
Section 31.6 — Temporary Watch Assignments 
For the purpose of filling a temporary vacancy in order to provide relief (i.e., vacation, medical, suspension, detail, etc.) for a police period, the Employer shall first designate the watch(es) to provide the relief and shall seek volunteers to satisfy its needs from the specific watch(es). If there are more volunteers than required, the volunteer with the greatest seniority from the designated watch(es) shall be selected. If there are not sufficient volunteers, the Officer with the lowest seniority from the designated watch(es) shall be selected. 
Once watch assignments are made, changes will not be made except for: (1) Officers identified as Personnel Concerns, (2) Officers in a limited or convalescent duty for the duration of that status, (3) Officers on restricted duty, (4) Officers who have been relieved of their police powers, (5) to fill a temporary vacancy not to exceed three periods (for example, furlough, suspension, medical, detail), initially filled by volunteers, then by reverse seniority, or (6) upon mutual agreement of the Officer seeking the change and the Department (provided no such agreement shall involuntarily displace any other Officer's selected watch assignment). These changes in watch assignments shall be made only for the duration of the circumstances giving rise to the change, after which the Officer will return to his or her previous watch assignment and will be made only for operational needs. 
When watch assignments are changed in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the provisions of Article 20 shall not apply. Changes in watch assignment not in accordance with the provision of this Section shall require compensation of the Officer in accordance with Article 20 (i.e., time and one-half for all hours worked outside of the Officer's selected watch).

APPENDIX K 


HIGH RISK PREGNANCY SCREENING PROGRAM 
In order to reduce the risk of a premature birth and the attendant health risks to mother and child and to avoid the costs associated with same, the City offers a high risk pregnancy screening program. The program is part of the medical advisor program. 
Under the program, a pregnant employee, spouse or dependent is encouraged to notify the medical advisor during the first trimester of pregnancy. During the telephone interview, the nurse reviewers will collect information on the health status of the prospective mother, her medical history, and conduct a health risk assessment to determine if she meets criteria for a high risk pregnancy. 
If the prospective mother does not meet criteria, the medical advisor would offer educational materials on pregnancy and advise her that they will be following up with a call in her second trimester of pregnancy. Further, they will advise her that they are available if she has any questions about her pregnancy. Subsequent follow up will depend on the course of the pregnancy. As delivery approaches, they will advise her about expected lengths of stay postpartum. 
If the prospective mother meets criteria for a high risk pregnancy, the medical advisor will contact her physician to discuss the risk factors and identify what steps, if any, are appropriate to reduce the risk of early delivery. They will follow the case as appropriate. If home health or other services available under the plan are necessary, they will approve the care plan and negotiate discounts for approved services. They will be available as a resource to both the prospective mother and her physician. 
APPENDIX L 
AFFIDAVITS IN DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS 
1. 
No affidavit will be required in support of anonymous complaints of criminal conduct. IPRA and IAD shall continue the current and past practice with respect to classifying allegations as either criminal or excessive force. Allegations of excessive force shall not be classified as criminal for purposes of avoiding the affidavit requirement. 

2. 
Anonymous complaints of Medical Roll Abuse and/or Residency violations will not be made the subject of a Complaint Register (CR) investigation until verified, consistent with the current procedure. If the anonymous complaint has been verified, no affidavit will be required. 

3. 
Where a supervisor receives an allegation of misconduct from a citizen, the supervisor will not be required to sign an affidavit. 

4. 
Where one Department member makes an allegation of misconduct against another Department member, neither Department member will be required to sign an affidavit because both Department members are subject to discipline for making a false report under the Rule 14 of the Department's Rules and Regulations. 

5. 
A complaint which is supported by an affidavit will not require additional affidavits in support of additional allegations within the same complaint. 

6. 
In all other cases, IPRA and IAD will make a good faith effort to obtain an appropriate affidavit from the complainant within a reasonable time. An "appropriate affidavit" in the case of a citizen complainant is one where the complainant affirms under oath that the allegation(s) and statement(s) made by the complainant are true. 

7. 
When an appropriate affidavit cannot be obtained from a citizen complainant, the head of either IPRA or IAD may sign an appropriate affidavit according to the following procedure. An "appropriate affidavit" in the case of the head of either IPRA or IAD is an affidavit wherein the agency head states he or she has reviewed objective verifiable evidence of the type listed below, the affidavit will specify what evidence has been reviewed and in reliance upon that evidence, the agency head affirms that it is necessary and appropriate for the investigation to continue. 

8. 
The types of evidence the agency head must review and may rely upon will be dependent on the type of case, but may include arrest and case reports, medical records, statements of witnesses and complainants, video or audio tapes, and photographs. This list is illustrative only and is not to be considered exclusive or exhaustive. 

9. 
In the case of an investigation of the type normally conducted by IPRA, the head of IAD will execute the affidavit described above, if the head of IAD believes execution of the required affidavit is appropriate under the facts of the case based upon the evidence received at that time. In the case of an investigation of the type normally conducted by IAD, the head of IPRA will execute the affidavit described above if the head of IPRA believes the 


required affidavit is appropriate under the facts of the case based upon the evidence received at that time. 
10. 
No Officer will be required to answer any allegation of misconduct unless it is supported by an appropriate affidavit, except as specified in paragraphs one through five above. In the event that no affidavit is received within a reasonable time, the investigation will be terminated and no record of the complaint or investigation will appear on the Officer's Disciplinary History. 

11. 
Upon the receipt of a complaint which requires an affidavit, IPRA or IAD may conduct a preliminary investigation into those allegations but no Complaint Register (CR) number will be issued unless and until the required affidavit is obtained. 


APPENDIX M

K. The Arbitrator will issue a short, written decision no later than sixty (60) days after the completion of the last day of any scheduled block of hearings. His or her decision shall be based upon the record developed by the parties before and at the hearing, and shall include a brief written explanation of the basis for his or her conclusion and shall include reference to the evidence considered and the role that evidence played in reaching his or her decision. 
L. If the parties mutually agree, the Arbitrator presiding over the expedited arbitration held pursuant to this Appendix M shall be selected from the panel provided for in Appendix Q, applicable to arbitration of suspension grievances pursuant to Section 9.6.B. In the absence of mutual agreement to utilize the panel, the parties shall select the Arbitrator pursuant to the process set forth in Section 9.3.A. 
APPENDIX N 
PROCEDURES FOR INJURY ON DUTY AND RECURRENCE CLAIMS 
An Officer who has been certified as injured on duty shall be provided a list of available physicians for treatment. The list of available physicians shall indicate the physicians’ medical specialties and the physicians shall be members in good standing of a network of worker’ compensation physicians qualified to render appropriate medical care for the injury claimed. The Officer will select a physician from the list provided by the Employer. The Medical Services Section will refer the Officer to the physician selected by the Officer. 
An Officer claiming a recurrence of an injury on duty will have his or her claim evaluated by a physician from the Medical Services Section.  A claim of a recurrence of an injury on duty includes a claim by an Officer that an injury, illness or condition is related to an injury on duty. 
If the Medical Services Section physician finds the injury, illness or condition complained of is not a recurrence of or related to an injury on duty, the Medical Services Section will provide the Officer with the list of physicians described above. The Officer will select a physician from the list provided by the Medical Services Section and the Medical Services Section will refer the Officer to the physician selected by the Officer (Referral Physician). 
The parties may accept the Referral Physician’s finding, which shall be final and binding on both the Officer and the Employer, or either party may seek an Independent Medical Examination (IME).  The physician conducting the IME (IME Referral Physician) shall be certified in the appropriate medical specialty(ies) and shall be selected by the Officer from a list of physicians provided by the Employer, which shall indicate the physicians’ certified medical specialty(ies), who are members in good standing of a network of physicians qualified to render IMEs. The Medical Services Section will refer the Officer to the IME Referral Physician selected by the Officer for an examination.  The IME Referral Physician shall consider all documents and medical records considered by the Referral Physician as well as the Referral Physician’s finding. The IME Referral Physician’s finding shall specify the reasons for the finding and shall be supported by the evidence in the documents and medical records.  The finding of the IME Referral Physician shall be final and binding on both the Officer and the Employer. 
The following shall apply if the Medical Services Section finds that the injury, illness or condition complained of is not a recurrence of or related to an injury on duty and it is later determined, pursuant to the process described above, that the injury, illness or condition complained of is a recurrence of or related to an injury on duty. Under these circumstances, the twelve (12) month period of time for which an Officer receives full pay and benefits as set forth in Section 18.1 shall be extended and the Officer shall receive, in addition to the twelve (12) month period of time set forth in Section 18.1, full pay and benefits from the date the Medical Services Section initially found that the injury, illness or condition complained of was not a recurrence of or related to an injury on duty through the date it is later certified by the Medical Services Section that the injury, illness or condition complained of is a recurrence of or related to an injury on duty. 
APPENDIX O 
SUBROGATION LANGUAGE FOR CITY OF CHICAGO 
In the event the Plan provides benefits for injury, illness, medical care or other loss (the "Injury") to any person, the Plan is subrogated to all present and future rights of recovery that person, his or her parents, heirs, guardians, executors, or other representatives (individually and collectively called the "Participant") may have arising out of the Injury. The Plan's subrogation rights include, without limitation, all rights of recovery a Participant has: 1) against any person, insurance company or other entity that is in any way responsible for providing or does provide damages, compensation, indemnification or benefits for the Injury; 2) under any law or policy of insurance or accident benefit plan providing No Fault, Personal Injury Protection or financial responsibility insurance; 3) under uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance; 4) under motor vehicle medical reimbursement insurance; and, 5) under specific risk or group accident and health coverage or insurance, including, without limitation, premises or homeowners medical reimbursement, athletic team, school or workers compensation coverages or insurance. 
Upon notice of an Injury claim, the Plan may assert a subrogation lien to the extent it has provided, or may be required to provide, Injury-related benefits. Notice of either the Plan's right of subrogation or the Plan's subrogation lien is sufficient to establish the Plan's rights of subrogation and entitlement to reimbursement from insurers, third parties, or other persons or entities against whom a Participant may have an Injury-related right of recovery. The Plan shall be entitled to intervene in or institute legal action when necessary to protect its subrogation or reimbursement rights. 
The Participant and anyone acting on his or her behalf shall promptly provide the Plan or its authorized agents with information it deems appropriate to protect its right of subrogation and shall do nothing to prejudice that right and shall cooperate fully with the Plan in the enforcement of its subrogation rights. Reasonable attorney's fees and costs of Participant's attorney shall be paid first from any recovery by or on behalf of a Participant, and the amount of the Plan's subrogation claim shall be paid next from such recovery. Neither a Participant nor his or her attorney or other representative is authorized to accept subrogation or other Injury-related reimbursement payments on behalf of the Plan, to negotiate or compromise the Plan's subrogation claim, or to release any right of recovery prior to the payment of the Plan's subrogation claim. 
The Participant and all other parties to a recovery are required to contact the Plan to determine, and arrange to pay the Plan's subrogation claim at or prior to the time an Injury-related payment or settlement is made to or for the benefit of the Participant. If the Participant obtains a payment or settlement from a party without the Plan's knowledge and agreement, the Plan shall be entitled to immediate reimbursement of its total subrogation claim from the Participant or any party providing any Injury-related payment. In the alternative, the Plan, in its sole discretion, may deny payment of benefits to or on behalf of the Participant for any otherwise covered claim incurred by the Participant until the amount of the unpaid coverage is equal to and offset by the unrecovered amount of the Plan's subrogation claim. 
The Plan Administrator or its authorized agents are vested with full and final discretionary authority to construe subrogation and other Plan terms and to reduce or compromise the amount of the Plan's recoverable interest where, in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator or its authorized agents, circumstances warrant such action. The Plan shall not be responsible for any litigation-related expenses or attorney fees incurred by or on behalf of a Participant in connection with an Injury claim unless the Plan shall have specifically agreed in writing to pay such expenses or fees. 
The payment of benefits to or on behalf of the Participant is contingent on both the Participant's full compliance with the Plan's provisions, including the subrogation provision, and, when the Plan deems appropriate, the Participant's signing of a reimbursement agreement. However, the Participant's failure to sign this reimbursement agreement will not affect the Plan's subrogation rights or its right to assert a lien against any source of possible recovery and to collect the amount of its subrogation claim.

(5) day suspension or less and the discipline for the non-probationary police Officer is subsequently rescinded or reduced, any discipline imposed on the probationary police officer may be reviewed in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement and the City will not assert timeliness provided the Officer has completed successfully his or her probationary period. 
APPENDIX Q 
GROUND RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF SUSPENSION GRIEVANCES PURSUANT TO SECTION 9.6.B AND 9.6.C 
The following procedures shall apply to arbitrations of grievances 
challenging suspensions of eleven (11) to three hundred sixty-five (365) days. 
A. The Lodge and the Employer have agreed to a panel of five (5) Arbitrators who shall comprise the exclusive list of Arbitrators to preside over the suspension grievances. The five (5) Arbitrators are:  . Each December the Lodge and the City shall each be permitted to strike one (1) Arbitrator from the panel for any reason. In the event an Arbitrator is removed from the panel, the parties shall attempt to agree upon a replacement Arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon a replacement, they shall request a list of seven (7) Arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association, each of whom must be a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Within ten (10) days after receipt of the list, the parties shall select an Arbitrator. Both the Employer and the Lodge shall alternately strike names from the list. The remaining person shall be the added to the panel. In the event the Lodge and the City each strike an Arbitrator from the panel as part of the December process, and if the parties are unable to agree upon replacement Arbitrators, the parties shall request two lists from the American Arbitration Association to be used to select the two replacement Arbitrators. 
B. Within ten (10) days of the Lodge electing to forward the suspension grievance to arbitration, the parties shall meet and select an Arbitrator from the panel. The parties shall inform the Arbitrator of the Arbitrator’s appointment and request a hearing date within sixty (60) days. If the Arbitrator is unable to provide a hearing date within sixty (60) days from the date of being contacted, the parties shall select another Arbitrator from the panel who is able to provide a hearing date within sixty (60) days. Upon appointment of the Arbitrator, but prior to the date on which a cancellation fee would be incurred, and unless they have already done so, the parties shall schedule a date to conduct a settlement conference to attempt to resolve the grievance. More than one suspension grievance may be discussed at the settlement conference. If the parties are unable to resolve the suspension grievance, they shall proceed with the Arbitration Process outlined in this Memorandum of Understanding. 
C. Provided the Lodge accepts a hearing date within sixty (60) days of appointment of the Arbitrator, the Officer will not be required to serve the suspension, nor will the suspension be entered on the Officer’s disciplinary record, until the Arbitrator rules on the merits of the grievance. In the event additional day(s) of hearing may be required to resolve the grievance, such additional day(s) shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days of the first day of hearing. If the Lodge is not ready to proceed on a scheduled hearing date, the Officer shall be required to serve the suspension prior to the Arbitrator ruling on the merits of the grievance. 
D. The authority and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 9.7 and 9.8 of the Agreement. 
E. The provisions of this Appendix Q supersede Appendix S of the predecessor collective bargaining agreement. However, nothing shall prohibit or require the parties agreeing upon an expedited or “fast track” arbitration procedure for a specific grievance or category of grievances. 
APPENDIX R PROCEDURES FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW 
Any Officer covered by this Agreement who has been involuntarily removed from active duty for psychological reasons has a right to file a grievance pursuant to Section 9.4 of this Agreement. In order to achieve a fair and prompt resolution of such a grievance, the Lodge and the Employer agree that these procedures will be followed. 
I. ISSUES FOR REVIEW 
A. Is the Grievant presently psychologically fit to perform the duties of a full duty police officer? 
B. Was the Grievant psychologically capable of performing the duties of a full duty police Officer at the time he or she was removed from duty or at any time thereafter? If so, on what date? 
The duties of a full duty police Officer shall include the ability to perform the duties set forth in the following two paragraphs. 
Police Officers, as part of and empowered by the community, protect the lives, property, and rights of all people, maintain order, and enforce the law impartially. They work in partnership with the community to respond to crime and neighborhood disorder. They work various shifts and days as assigned, patrolling an assigned beat by vehicle and/or on foot in order to observe conditions, intervene in observed situations that require their attention, and provide a visible presence to prevent crime from occurring. Police Officers respond to a variety of assignments such as crimes in progress, accidents, damage to property, and domestic and other disturbances. They may have to deal with unruly persons and overcome forceful resistance. They protect crime scenes until detectives or superiors arrive; examine the scene for evidence, and question suspects, victims, and witnesses in order to gather information. Under Chicago's Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS), Police Officers participate in and conduct neighborhood meetings to identify community concerns and work with supervisors and peers to analyze crime patterns and develop responses to criminal activity in an area. 
Police Officers respond to a variety of emergencies and must pursue suspects on foot over a variety of terrain and obstacles. Police Officers prepare reports, recording all details of an incident; prepare arrest slips to start the booking procedure; and testify in court. Police Officers must possess the ability to physically control suspects and to safely discharge firearms to protect citizens and/or themselves. They perform a wide variety of other tasks, such as directing pedestrian or vehicular traffic, issuing traffic citations, and assisting sick and injured persons in a variety of ways. They perform all other related duties as required and directed in order to serve citizens by enforcing laws and protecting lives and property. 
The Panel must find that an Officer is either fit or unfit for full duty as a Police Officer. When an Officer is found fit for full duty, the Panel may recommend that the Grievant participate in counseling. However, the Panel's recommendation may not be conditioned upon such participation. 
II. 
INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW BY THE PANEL 

A. 
The Grievant must execute a release in proper legal form authorizing the Lodge to have access to the Employer's psychological files. The term "psychological files" does not include the results of any standardized psychological/ psychiatric tests. 

B. 
No documentation in the possession of any member of the Panel shall be withheld if requested by another Panel member. Each member of the Panel shall provide to the other members of the Panel the results of any standardized psychological/psychiatric tests, conclusions based on said tests, and each Panel member's rationale for finding the Grievant fit or unfit. 

C. 
The mutually-appointed member of the Panel may interview, examine, and evaluate the Grievant and may request additional data through the representatives of the Lodge and the Employer. Any member of the Panel is authorized to review any and all information or documents contained in Complaint Register files that are open, not-sustained, and/or sustained. However, no member of the Panel shall review any information or documents in Complaint Register files in which the finding was exonerated or unfounded. The restrictions on the retention of Complaint Register files set forth in Section 8.4 of this Agreement shall also apply to the Psychological Review process. 


III.
 PROCEDURES 

A. 
All members of the Panel shall meet and discuss the Grievant's fitness and reach a conclusion regarding fitness. 

B. 
The mutually-appointed member of the Panel shall draft the Panel's decision regarding the Grievant's fitness. The decision must specifically address whether the Officer was fit for some or all of the time the Officer has been removed from duty and the Officer's present fitness. The decision must also address all of the issues submitted for review and state the evidence relied upon as the basis for the decision. 

C. 
The mutually-appointed member of the Panel shall send the draft of the Panel's decision to the Panel members appointed by the Lodge and the Employer for verification of their representations within fourteen (14) days from the date of the meeting of the Panel. The members of the Panel appointed by the Lodge and the Employer shall have fourteen (14) days from the postmark date of the draft report to verify said representations and to provide suggestions, recommendations, and comments to the mutually-appointed member of the Panel. The mutually-appointed member of the Panel may make any revisions to the decision based upon the comments received from the other members of the Panel. The final decision shall issue no later than fourteen (14) days from the postmark date of the latest response of the other members of the Panel, if any. In all cases, the decision of the Panel shall issue no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the meeting of the Panel. Failure to meet these time 


guidelines does not divest the Panel of authority to make fitness for duty decisions, nor expose the Employer to any liability. 
D. Copies of the decision of the Panel shall be provided immediately to the representatives of the Lodge and the Employer. 
APPENDIX S GRIEVANCE MEDIATION PROGRAM GROUND RULES 
The parties agree to establish a grievance mediation program in accordance with the following ground rules: 
1) Grievance mediation sessions shall be scheduled by the parties by mutual agreement, but not more frequently than once quarterly.  Such mediation sessions shall be presided over by an arbitrator/mediator, to be selected by mutual agreement of the parties from among the following three (3) arbitrators/mediators: Edwin Benn, Peter Meyers and George Roumell. 
2) In order to be eligible for submission to this mediation pilot program, grievances must be of the “contract interpretation” variety (i.e., neither disciplinary nor medical grievances shall be eligible for this process), the Lodge must have invoked arbitration of the grievance, and there are no issues with respect to the procedural arbitrability of the grievance(s). 
3) Each party shall identify up to four (4) grievances for presentation at each session (i.e., a total of eight (8) grievances per session). The parties shall agree upon the agenda of grievances to be submitted at least fourteen (14) days prior to the mediation session, and shall jointly prepare an agreed upon statement of the issue(s) presented in each grievance. 
4) At least ten (10) days before the session, the parties shall confer for the purpose of exchanging the documents upon which each intends to rely at the session, including copies of any correspondence, orders, statements, etc. The parties are expected to resolve any disputes regarding authenticity of any proposed documents or other exhibits prior to the mediation session. 
5) Within three (3) days of the session, each party shall prepare and exchange with the other party a written statement, for each grievance, of no more than one (1) page in length, outlining its position and arguments concerning the grievance. The governing principle in this mediation process, to be adhered to by both parties, is that there be no claims or defenses offered for the first time at the mediation. 
6) A party’s failure to comply with any of the timelines set forth in this Appendix shall result in the cancellation of the mediation session and assessment of the Mediator’s cancellation fee and expenses against that party. Otherwise, the parties shall split evenly the cost of the Mediator’s expenses and fees. Each party shall bear its own fees and expenses related to the mediation. 
7) Within three (3) days of the session, each party shall submit to the Mediator a set of the documents previously provided to the other party. Only under extraordinary circumstances will a party be allowed to introduce a document at the hearing that was not previously identified and submitted. As part of the submission to the Mediator, each party may submit the one (1) page written statement, for each grievance, referenced in paragraph 3 above, outlining its position concerning the grievance. 
8) At the session, each party may be represented by one (1) attorney and one (1) party representative. The grievant may also be present; if there are multiple grievants, then one grievant representative may be present. Each party shall make a presentation of no more than thirty (30) uninterrupted minutes in length (including rebuttal) with respect to each grievance. There shall be no witnesses; however, if the mediator indicates that hearing from the grievant would be helpful to the mediator, the grievant may make a statement. The thirty (30) allowed minutes shall include the grievant’s statement. Each party shall otherwise make its presentation through offer(s) of proof. The rules of evidence shall not apply and there shall be no procedural or substantive legal objections to the parties’ presentations or to the evidence submitted at mediation (e.g., objections based on lack of foundation). There shall be no recording of the session. The parties expect that the Mediator will conduct the mediation by initially having both parties in the same room making their initial presentation(s), and will thereafter separate the parties to conduct the mediation, as the Mediator deems appropriate. 
9) Each party’s representative(s) shall come to the session with authority to resolve each grievance scheduled to be heard, and shall have authority to enter into a settlement agreement. Where a settlement agreement is reached, the parties shall reduce to writing the terms of the agreement and execute such agreement prior to the conclusion of the mediation session. 
10) Any settlement reached at mediation shall be binding with respect to that particular grievance(s) only, and shall have no precedential value with respect to any other grievance, nor may it may be used or referred to in any subsequent proceeding between the parties, unless both parties agree in writing. The mediation session(s) shall be confidential, and nothing said by either party at the session(s) may be used, referred to or relied upon in any subsequent proceeding. 
11) The Mediator shall not be eligible to serve as an arbitrator with respect to any grievances submitted to the Mediator as part of the mediation pilot program. 
12) The location of the mediation session shall rotate among the offices of the Lodge, the Management and Labor Affairs Section or another location agreed to by the parties. 
13) Upon mutual agreement, the parties may strike the name(s) of one or more of the Mediators identified in Paragraph (1) above and, by agreement, substitute a different Mediator to replace the stricken name(s). 
14) Both parties acknowledge their shared interest in streamlining the grievance/arbitration process and providing for timely and appropriate resolutions of grievances.  
APPENDIX T 
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING 
Pursuant to the award issued In the Matter of the Arbitration Between the City of Chicago and Fraternal Order of Police, Chicago Lodge No. 7 by Arbitrator Edwin H. Benn on April 16, 2010, the Chicago Police Department's drug and alcohol testing program shall be amended as follows: 
A. The Department's existing policies and orders regarding random drug testing shall be revised to include the following components: 
1. Testing for the presence of alcohol while on duty. 
a. 
Officers selected for random drug testing shall also be tested for alcohol. 

b. 
Upon notification to submit to random testing, Officers shall continue to report to the Random Drug Testing Unit for the collection of urine specimens. 

c. 
The Department may use urine specimens to test for the presence of both drugs specified in this agreement and alcohol. The Department may also test for alcohol using a breath alcohol test administered by a qualified tester using a certified and calibrated Breathalyzer. 

d. 
The initial and confirmatory test levels for a positive presence of alcohol shall be a breath alcohol level of .021 or its urine concentration equivalent, unless a different standard is required by paragraph (e) below. 

e. 
If the test reveals a breath alcohol level of .021 through .039 or their urine concentration equivalents, the Officer shall be relieved from duty without compensation until the next duty day and shall submit to drug and alcohol testing prior to his/her return to duty. If the return-to-duty test reveals an alcohol level of .00, the Officer may return to duty and shall not be subject to discipline based on the initial test result; however, during the six- (6-) month period following the date of the initial test, the Officer will be selected for random drug and alcohol testing from an eligibility pool consisting of similarly situated Officers. 


If the return-to-duty test or any test administered within the six-(6-) month period described above reveals any presence of alcohol, the Officer shall be relieved from duty without compensation until ordered to return to duty, and the Random Drug Testing Unit will refer the matter to the Internal Affairs Division. 
If the test reveals a breath alcohol level equal to or greater than .04 or its urine concentration equivalent, the Officer shall be relieved from duty without compensation until ordered to return to duty, and the Random Drug Testing Unit will refer the matter to the Internal Affairs Division. In the event discipline is recommended, the Internal Affairs Division shall consider whether to agree to hold the discipline in abeyance in exchange for the Officer's agreement to participate in a rehabilitation program, remain drug and alcohol free for a defined period and comply with other appropriate terms and conditions (i.e., a "last chance" agreement). 
An Officer who is relieved from duty without compensation in accordance with this subsection may utilize accrued elective time during the unpaid period of absence. 
f. The above changes shall be implemented effective January 1, 2012, or thereafter. 
2. Bidders and/or applicants for assignments in the Narcotics Section, Gang Enforcement Section, Gang Investigation Section and Vice Control Section in the Organized Crime Division and the Intelligence Section in the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Division shall be required to submit to a drug and alcohol test prior to appointment. Thereafter, all Officers assigned to these Units shall be selected for random drug and alcohol testing from an eligibility pool consisting solely of Officers assigned to such Units. 
B. The procedures applicable to drug testing conducted by the Department, regardless of whether the basis for the testing is random, for cause or any other basis, shall be amended to include the following: 
1. 
Ecstasy (MDA/MDMA) and steroids shall be added to the panel of substances for which the Department tests, and Methaqualone shall be removed from such panel. The modernized panel shall thus read as follows: 

2. 
Initial and confirmatory test levels will be consistent with the federal regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ("SAMHSA") for those substances covered by such regulations. 

3. 
During the term of this Agreement, the Department may add or remove additional substances to the panel referred to above when it has reasonable grounds for such addition or removal (such as when new drugs are developed or changes occur in patterns of consumption of dangerous or illegal drugs), provided that it shall provide Lodge 7 with thirty (30) days' advance written notice and, upon request, meet with Lodge 7 to negotiate the addition or removal of a substance to or from the panel. If the parties are unable to agree on the addition or removal of a substance from the panel, the dispute shall be resolved through the binding grievance arbitration procedure set forth in Article 


SUBSTANCE  INITIAL TEST LEVEL (ng/mL)  CONFIRMATORY TEST LEVEL (ng/mL)  
Anabolic Steroids  Any Presence  Any Presence  
Amphetamines  1000  500  
Barbiturates  300  200  
Benzodiazepines  300  200  
Cocaine Metabolites  300  150  
Marijuana Metabolites  50  15  
MDA/MDMA  250  200  
Methadone  300  200  
Opiates  2000  2000  
Phencyclidine  25  25  
Propoxyphene  300  200  

9. The sole issue before the Arbitrator shall be whether the Department has a reasonable basis for adding or removing the substance to or from the panel and for the initial and confirmatory test levels. 
4. If a test reveals a positive presence of a substance on the above panel or the abuse of prescription drugs, the Random Drug Testing Unit will continue to refer the matter to the Internal Affairs Division. 
C. Effective upon ratification, in any instance where an Officer discharges his/ her weapon, whether on or off duty, the Officer shall submit to drug and alcohol testing at the direction of the Internal Affairs Division or any superior authority. If the Officer has discharged his/her weapon off duty and the test reveals the presence of alcohol, the Department shall not discipline the Officer based solely on the results of the alcohol test when the Officer's actions are consistent with the Department's use of force guidelines. 
D. The Department's existing policies and orders regarding drug and alcohol use shall be amended to state that an Officer is prohibited from consuming alcohol within the four­(4-) hour period preceding the start of a previously scheduled shift or after receiving notice to report for duty. Alleged violations of this rule cannot result in discipline unless a test conducted pursuant to the testing procedures is positive. 
E. The Department will continue to conduct its drug and alcohol testing program in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Illinois State Police set forth in Title 20, Part 1286, of the Illinois Administrative Code. 
NOTICE TO SUPERVISORS REGARDING PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE 
Supervisors, including Watch Commanders, retain the flexibility, authority and discretion where circumstances warrant to issue reprimands to offending Officers for infractions. Second or even repeated infractions of minor rules may, but do not always, require increased punishment (particularly including loss of time or income) when an oral or written reprimand will suffice to achieve the goal of correcting improper behavior. 
There is some belief that a progressive system of discipline requires enhanced penalties no matter how insignificant the infraction. This is not correct. 
You are permitted and urged to use your judgment in determining the appropriate level of discipline. Officers in this Department are a valuable resource which should not be wasted or unduly restricted. 
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  REGARDING MAINTENANCE OF BENEFITS 
It is further understood that the below-listed benefits enjoyed by Officers covered by this Agreement will be maintained for the duration of the Agreement and shall not be diminished, modified, or eliminated during the term of the Agreement. 
Sickness in family time 
Change of uniforms at District 
Use of department lockers and mailboxes 
Use of gymnasium facilities during off-duty hours 
Physical and optical examinations 
Health care fringe benefits, including hospitalization insurance 
Furloughs and compensatory (baby) furloughs 
Marriage leave 
Pension benefits as provided by statute 
Utilization of compensatory time earned in partial tour or full tour 
segments consistent with Article 20 and Article 23.5 of Agreement. 
One half-hour lunch period taken during the tour of duty 
Life insurance rates, including cost of optional insurance 
Any obligation of the City of Chicago to indemnify Officers for punitive damages assessed, adjudged, or otherwise levied shall be based upon City Ordinances and/or State Statutes providing for such indemnification. 
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  REGARDING DISTRICT UNIT BID ASSIGNMENTS 
The Lodge and the Employer agree that Lodge members who have successfully bid for the position of district desk or district lockup keeper will continue to function in that position for the duration of this contract unless removed in accordance with the provisions of Section 23.9. 
The Lodge and the Employer further agree to open for bid in accordance with the provisions of Section 23.9 the position of District Watch Relief in each of the Patrol Division's 25 Districts. The member bidding for the position of District Watch Relief must be able to perform to the satisfaction of the Employer the functions of a desk Officer, lockup keeper and district review Officer after a period of orientation. Successful district bid members will be utilized in bid assignments before full duty non-bid members. When not required to function as district watch relief; the member will be assigned to district patrol duties. 
The Employer shall select the most senior qualified bidder for the position of District Watch Relief. If there are not sufficient bidders to fill a District Watch Relief position declared vacant by the Employer, the Employer shall fill such vacancy within its discretion. 
The following are the number of District Desk, District Lockup, and District Watch Relief positions subject to bid under the provisions of Section 23.9:

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  REGARDING BIDDING PROCEDURES 
The City of Chicago and the Fraternal Order of Police, Chicago Lodge No. 7, jointly agree that the following procedures and interpretations will apply to processing bids to Fill Recognized Vacancies in accordance with Section 23.8 of the contract: 
1. 
All sworn full duty non-probationary members below the career service rank of sergeant will be allowed to bid for one transfer request. Members who are currently on the medical roll but who are otherwise full duty will be allowed to bid. 

2. 
Bids for vacancies must be submitted in accordance with the instructions contained in the Recognized Vacancy Announcement and must be forwarded to the Management and Labor Affairs Section within 72 hours of the time the announcement is posted. Members may fax a copy of the bid to the Management and Labor Affairs Section to ensure timely receipt; however, two copies of the properly completed bid form must also be forwarded to the Management and Labor Affairs Section. The bid form must contain the signature of the member, and the signature of his or her commanding officer/ watch commander specifying the date and time the bid was submitted. 

3. 
A successful bidder may not bid for another recognized vacancy within one police period year unless reassigned by the Employer. For example, a member who submits a successful bid in the 11th period for a 12th period vacancy in 2000 is not eligible to submit another bid to fill a recognized vacancy until the 11th period of 2001 for a 12th period of 2001 vacancy. 

4. 
Probationary members may not submit a bid to fill a recognized vacancy while on probation. A probationary member whose probationary period will expire during the 72-hour period to submit bids, may submit a bid for a recognized vacancy. The member must be off probation at the time of the bid. A member whose probationary period expires after the 72-hour bid period but prior to the beginning of the period when the vacancy will be filled is not eligible to bid.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT REGARDING PHYSICAL FITNESS 
The City of Chicago and Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 7 jointly recognize that physical fitness of police Officers is of mutual benefit to the officers, the City and the public. 
Therefore, the City and the Lodge hereby agree to undertake a joint effort to develop a reasonable physical fitness program applicable to all bargaining unit members. 
The City and the Lodge hereby establish a Physical Fitness Committee consisting of 3 members designated by the Lodge and 3 members designated by the Superintendent of Police. The Committee may be assisted by such consultants or other individuals (paid for by the Employer, provided the Employer agrees to their participation) as may be necessary to accomplish its goals. 
The Committee's recommendations shall be advisory only. Upon receipt of the Committee's recommendations, the Superintendent may adopt or modify the recommended program. If the Superintendent modifies the program, he/she shall so notify the Committee and the Lodge in writing. Within ten (10) calendar days of such notice, the Lodge may request arbitration of the modifications under Article 9. The issue before the arbitrator shall be whether the modifications proposed by the Superintendent are reasonable. 
No Officer shall be discharged, suspended, relieved from duty, demoted, or disciplined in any manner under or relating to any physical fitness program. 
PHYSICAL FITNESS INCENTIVE 
In an effort to promote physical fitness among the Officers covered by this Agreement, the Employer and Lodge agree to the following: 
Beginning in 2001, every officer covered by this Agreement will have one opportunity annually to schedule an appointment for a physical fitness test. An Officer will have one opportunity to re-schedule the test, but will only be allowed to take the test once each year. The test must take place prior to November 1 of every year. 
An Officer will complete a waiver which indicates that he or she is volunteering to take this test and will not hold the Employer liable for any injuries or illness that occurs as a result of his or her participation in the testing process. 
• 
Successful completion of the physical fitness test will result in payment of a physical fitness premium of $350, payable December 1 of the year the Officer successfully completes the test. 

• 
It is understood that this is a voluntary program. Officers who participate in the physical fitness test will do so during off-duty hours without compensation. 

• 
Any injury, illness, or death that results from participation in this program will not be considered an Injury on Duty or a death in the performance of duty. 

• 
The performance requirement for each test is based on the State of Illinois P.O.W.E.R. test. Officers must pass every test and meet the minimum standards listed below to qualify for the physical fitness premium:
