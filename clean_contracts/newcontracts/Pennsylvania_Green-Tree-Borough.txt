A qualifying exigency includes (1) short notice deployment (2) military events and related activities (3) childcare and school activities (4) financial and legal arrangements (5) counseling (6) rest and recuperation (up to five days) (7) post-deployment activities and (8) any additional activities not listed but agreed to by the employer and the employee.

The FMLA also provides military caregiver leave for eligible employees who are family members or next of kin of covered service members up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12month period to care for a service member who has a serious illness or injury that was incuned in the line of duty while on active duty. This type of leave also permits eligible employees to take leave to care for veterans who are undergoing medical treatment recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty during the previous five years. The 26 weeks of military caregiver leave is provided for each service member and for each illness or injury incurred.

While on approved FMLA leave eligible employees will have health benefits maintained as if they had continued to work instead of taking the leave.

Spouses who are both employed by the Borough are entitled to a combined total of 12 weeks leave (rather than 12 weeks each) in any 12 month period for the birth or care of the employees child for the placement in adoption or foster care of a child and care after placement or for the care of a parent with a serious health condition. Eligible spouses who are both employed by the Borough are entitled to a combined total of 26 weeks leave in any 12-month period for a combination of FMLA leave to care for an injured service member and any other type of FMLA leave (rather than 26 weeks each).

This policy applies to all FMLA leaves for hourly and salaried employees whether FMLA leave was requested by the employee or designated by the Borough .

 If an employee is entitled to both FMLA leave and any type of accrued paid leave (e.g. vacation sick days personal days) the time periods will run concurrently and employees must use all available accrued paid leave while on FMLA leave.

If a leave of absence is eligible as FMLA leave then FMLA will be applied.

V.

 ELIGIBILITY FOR FMLA LEAVE To be eligible for FMLA an employee must have been employed by the Borough for at least 12 months and must have worked at least 125 hours during the 12-month period preceding the beginning of the leave. The employee must also provide appropriate medical certification of eligibility for FMLA leave. For purposes of determining FMLA leave eligibility for the next year following an employees FMLA leave the Borough will use the rolling method which means that it will measure the 12-month period backward from the date the employees second FMLA leave is scheduled to begin.

32  VI.

 REQUEST FOR FLMA LEA VE An employee must provide the Borough at least 3 days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable based on an expected bi1th placement for adoption or foster care or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or family member. Employees should submit FMLA requests to the Borough Manager.

The employees request for FMLA leave should   be in writing    set forth the reason for the requested leave    contain the anticipated duration of the leave and    designate the expected start date of the leave.

 If3 days advance notice is not practicable such as because of the lack of knowledge of approximately when leave will be required to begin a change in circumstances or a medical emergency notice must be given as soon as possible and practical taking into account all of the facts and circumstances in the individual case. This ordinarily means that employees are expected to give at least verbal notification to the Borough within one or two business days of when the need for leave becomes known to the employee.

When the leave is for planned medical treatment the employee must consult with the Borough and make a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt Borough operations subject to the approval of the health care provider.

 In those cases where an employee has not designated an absenceleave as FMLA leave and the Borough receives information indicating that the employees absenceleave may be for FMLA-covered reasons the Borough has the right to designate such absenceleave as FMLA leave and to count that time toward the employees total 12-week entitlement of FMLAcovered leave. In such circumstance the Borough may require the employee to have certification completed by a health care provider to confirm that the leave is for a FMLAcovered reason.

VII. REQUIRED  MEDICAL CERTIFICATION  The Borough will require medical certification to support FMLA leave. Each employee who may qualify for FMLA leave will be provided with an appropriate form requesting medical certification concerning the need for the employees absence. The employee must return the medical certification form to the Borough Manager within a reasonable time period (normalzy 15 calendar days after the employee receives the medical certification form).

Failure of an employee to return the ce1tification form on a timely basis in cases of foreseeable leave may delay the taking of FMLA leave. Failure of an employee to return the cenification fo1m on a timely basis in other cases may delay the continuation of FMLA leave.

33  Failure of an employee to return the ce11ification form at all will result m the loss of all FMLA benefits and protections because the leave will not be FMLA leave.

 If the minimum duration of the period of incapacity furnished by the health care provider is more than 3 days no re-certification will normally (see exceptions set forth below) be required until the minimum initial period of incapacity has passed. The Borough reserves the right however to request subsequent andor additional certification of FMLA leave every 3 days where the leave is for pregnancy chronic or permanentlong-term conditions under continuing supervision or a health care provider. The Borough further reserves the right to request subsequent andor additional ce11ification of FMLA leave where   Leave is on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis and the minimum period specified on the original certification as necessary for such leave and treatment has passed.

   The employee requests an extension of FMLA leave    Circumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly    The Borough receives information that casts doubt upon the employees stated reasons for the absence or    The Borough has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave andor its duration.

 The Borough may require a second medical opmwn at its own expense by a health care provider designated by the Borough (but who is not employed on a regular basis by the Borough) if it doubts the validity of a medical certification. If the first and second opinions differ the Borough may require the opinion of a third health care provider. The third health care provider must be approved jointly by the Borough and the employee and must be paid for by the Borough. The opinion of the third health care provider will be final and binding on the Borough and employee.

Pending receipt of the second (or third) medical op1mon the employee is provisionally entitled to FMLA leave. The employee is not entitled to be paid for the time or travel costs spent in acquiring the medical certifications but the employee may request a copy of the second (or third) medical opinion. If the certifications do not ultimately establish the employees entitlement to FMLA leave the leave will not be designated as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid or unpaid leave by the Borough under its other applicable policies.

Where the employees need for FMLA leave is due to the employees own serious health condition even if he or she does not receive treatment by a health care provider.

When intermittent or reduced leave schedule is requested the employee must attempt to work out a schedule with the Borough vhich meets the employees needs without unduly disrupting the Boroughs operations subject to the approval of the health care provider.

34  1here leave is taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis the Borough reserves the right to limit such leaves to the shortest period of time (one hour or less) that the Boroughs payroll system uses to account for absences or use of leave.

Further where intermittent or reduced schedule leave is requested the Borough may require the employee to transfer temporarily (during the period the intermittent or reduced schedule leave is required) to an available alternative position that better accommodates recurring absences or to a part-time schedule (provided that the employee is not required to take more leave than is medically necessary by virtue of such transfer). The alternative position will have equivalent pay and benefits but will not necessarily have equivalent duties.

In cases of intermittent or reduced leave schedule the amount of leave used toward an employees total 12-week FMLA entitlement will be determined on a pro-rated basis by comparing the employees former normal schedule with the new FMLA leave schedule.

IX.

 DELAYDENIAL  OF FMLA LEAVE  The Borough may delay andor deny FMLA leave under the following circumstances  where the employee fails to give timely advance notice when the leave for FMLA is foreseeable the Borough may delay the taking of FMLA leave until 3 days after the date the employee provides notice to the employer of the need for FMLA leave  where an employee fails to provide in a timely manner a requested medical certification to substantiate the need for FMLA leave due to a serious health condition the Borough may delay continuation of FMLA leave until the employee submits the certification  where an employee never provides requested medical certification to substantiate the need for FMLA leave due to a serious health condition the leave is not FMLA leave.

X.

 EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFITS DURING FMLA LEAVE Group health care coverage will continue for employees eligible for benefits who are on leave as if they were still working. Employees who are granted an approved FMLA leave must arrange to pay their share of premiums to the Borough during the absence. If the leave is paid premiums will continue to be paid through payroll deductions. If the leave is unpaid employees are responsible for making sure the Borough receives premium payments by the normal payroll dates. The Borough will provide a schedule of payment amounts and due dates at the beginning of unpaid FMLA leave.

If an employee chooses not to return to work after an approved FMLA leave the Borough may recover from the employee the cost of any payments made to maintain the 35  employees health insurance unless the failure to return is because of a serious health condition or reasons beyond the employees control. Benefit entitlement based on length of service will be calculated as of the last paid work day before the start of the unpaid absence.

 36  XI.

 RETURN TO WORK REQUIREMENTS Employees on approved FMLA leave may be required to periodicalJy repo11 their status and intent and ability to return to work. Employees are requested to notify the Borough Manager at least two weeks in advance of their anticipated return to work date so that their availability for work can be included on the applicable work schedule.

Where an employee has taken FMLA leave for hisher own serious health condition that made the employee unable to perfonn hisher job the employee may be required to obtain and produce certification of their ability to return to work and undergo a fitness for duty examination. This requirement will only be imposed where all similarly situated employees in the employees job class are required to undergo such examination before returning to work from workers compensation disability or FMLA leave. The fitness for duty certification for return from FMLA leave will only be sought concerning the particular health condition that caused the employees need for FMLA leave. This fitness-for-duty exam will not be required when the employee has taken an intermittent leave for hisher health condition.

 XII.

 REINSTATEMENT AT CONCLUSION OFFMLA LEAVE  At the conclusion of FMLA leave an employee will be reinstated to an equivalent position with equivalent terms and conditions as the employee held prior to taking FMLA leave. An employee has no greater right to reinstatement and to other benefits and conditions of employment however than if the employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period.

 If at the conclusion of the 12-weeks of FMLA leave the employee is unable to return to work the employee no longer has the protections of FMLA. However the employee may have other forms of leave available that are not covered under the FMLA policy.

XIII.

 PENALTIES FOR FRAUD  An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from an employer is not protected by FMLAs job restoration or maintenance of health benefits provisions. In addition the Borough will take all available appropriate disciplinary action against such employee due to such fraud.
