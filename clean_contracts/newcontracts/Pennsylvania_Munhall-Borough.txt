For purposes of overtime, a pay period shall be two (2) work weeks as defined by this contract.

Emergencv overtime: Overtime required to relieve an immediate hazard which may endanger life or property shall be considered "emergency overtime" and shall be assigned by the person in charge of the shift in the manner which he deems most appropriate to expedite reliefofthe situation. Ifthe officer in charge of the shift has less than one (l) hour's notice ofthe unavailability of the minimum number of men required to fill a shift, he shall endeavor to assign overtime according to the provisions of Article V, Paragraph 9 hereof, but may at his option consider such overtime as emergency overtime, and fill it as permitted by the provisions of this Paragraph.

c. 
Any policeman who is unavailable for overtime when called shall not be charged with those overtime hours for purposes of equalization. However, any policeman who does not wish to work the overtime detail shall be charged with the time for purposes of equalization. For extra detail work in the situation where an officer is scheduled and calls off less than 72 hours prior to the start of the shift, any officer called to cover that work who declines will not be charged on the rotation schedule for declining that work. 

d. 
During a shift when overtime is required, policemen who arc on duty, in court, on sick leave, death leave, emergency leave, vacation, compensatory time off, on a trade shift, and/or who have worked twelve (12) consecutive hours or more, shall not be considered to have been eligible or available for general overtime assignments of equalization, except as provided in (f) below. 

e. 
If sufficient volunteers are not available, the overtime shall be assigned on a non-volunteer basis. Non-volunteer assignments shall be equalized among all policemen and shall be assigned by rotation, starting with the policeman having the least seniority. 

f. 
A policeman who does not work eighty (80) hours in any pay period because of sick leave or injury, will not be considered eligible or available for general overtime or private duty assignments during that pay period, or for the remainder of that pay period.

Paragraph No. l in this Article. 
16. When a police officer works overtime, as it is defined in this Contract, he may request that he be compensated with comp time a/k/a time owed rather than being paid for his overtime pay. The Chief of Police and Mayor have the sole discretion to determine whether comp time a/k/a time owed will be granted when requested by a police officer. If granted, the comp time a/k/a time owed will match the rate of pay that is being comped, i.e., comp time a/k/a time owed which is granted for work performed at a time-and-a-half rate of pay will result in one-and-a-half hours time owed for each hour worked.

ARTICLEX SICK LEAVE AND SHORT-TERM DISABILITY INCOME PROTECTION 
In the event a full-time officer is unable to work due to an illness or accident not otherwise compensated for by statute and is not receiving benefits under the disability provisions of the Police Pension Fund, the following sickness and accident benefit provisions are provided: 
1. Nom1al Sickness and Accident Leave Provision. Each full-time police officer, upon commencement of service with the Department shall be entitled to sick and accident leave 
as follows:  
YEARS OF SERVICE Up to one year Over one year  AMOUNT 5 days 12 days  

Unused sick and accident leave may be accumulated to ninety (90) days. No additional allowances shall be made except as provided under subparagraph "2(b)" below. It is understood 
15 
that the Borough retains the right to take appropriate action for any violation or abuse of sick leave, and may, when appropriate, in order to maintain proper sick leave provisions, require an examination ofany police officer. Any examination required by the Borough shall be directed to the police officer in writing, signed by the Chief of Police, Mayor or President of Council and shall be conducted by a licensed physician appointed and paid for by the Borough. Any full­time officer who refuses to submit to such an examination shall be subject to discipline. The result of the examination, including any discipline arising therefrom, shall be subject to arbitration pursuant to the provisions ofparties' grievance procedure. 
2. Extended Sickness and Accident Provision. Subject to the conditions set forth below, for the first thirty (30) calendar days of non-work related sickness or accident, policemen will be paid their salary in full. In effect, therefore, it means four (4) (plus) work weeks, or two (plus) pay periods. This full pay provision is subject to the following conditions: 
a. 
The policemen will have first deducted from current accumulated sick leave the days used during the first thirty (30) days, to the extent of such current and accumulated sick leave to the police officer's credit. 

b. 
To the extent that current and accumulated sick leave to the police officer's credit is insufficient to provide for full pay during the calendar thirty (30) days, the policemen will be required to use current unused vacation time. A police officer will have the right to elect to use unused current ,·acalion time during the first thirty (30) days instead of current or accumulated sick leave. However, such election shall be made within two (2) weeks of the police officer's return to service and such election may not otherwise be made retroactively. 

c. 
To the extent that current and accumulated sick leave and current unused vacation time is not sufficient for the thirty (30) day period, the Borough will "advance" up to twenty-two (22) working days of sick leave. Such days "advanced" by the Borough will be deducted from the following year or year's current sick leave and there shall be no future accumulation of sick leave until fully repaid. Upon retirement, ''advanced" days remaining unpaid will be deducted from the police office's last month's wages or any other benefits owed by the Borough. Days "advanced" by the Borough shall ne\'er exceed twenty-two (22) days for 


16 
any one police officer at any time during his service with the Borough. It is understood that "advanced" days, later "repaid" with current sick leave, would make "advance" days again available to the police officer. 
d. 
For the next twelve (12) calendar months, that is, for seventy-eight (78) weeks of disability, an extended sickness and accident insurance policy will provide two-thirds (2/3) of the police officer's basic salary, payable weekly. Such policy has been secured and will be continued, during the tenn of this agreement, to be equivalent to the prevailing policy provided by the Municipal Employers Insurance Trust. The Borough, in order to assure efficient administration of any claims ofpolice personnel, will obtain claim fonns for the affected officer or his family and upon request will assist in the proper completion of the forms and advise the officer and his family on his rights under the policy. In the event of any delay in receipt of insurance proceeds, the Borough will advance the amount otherwise due from the insurance company for any weekly benefit. In the event ofany advancement by the Borough, the Borough shall have the right to retain the insurance proceeds later received, or to make demand upon the individual officer for such advancement made by the Borough. Upon failure of the officers to comply, this agreement will be sufficient authority for the Borough to deduct from future salary amount of the money advanced by the Borough for which the officer has received insurance proceeds. 

e. 
Except as to the normal sick leave provisions set forth in Paragraph la above, the extended sickness and accident provision, including insurance coverage and "advancement" ofsick leave by the Borough will not be effective until a police officer has served fifteen ( 15) months with the Police Department as a full-time police officer. 

f. 
Amounts received under the sickness and accident insurance policy shall be ignored in calculating future pension benefits of the officer under the Police Pension Plan. The time during which said payments arc received shall, however, be considered as time of service with the Borough for Police Pension Plan purposes and for longe·dty. 

g. 
A police officer may elect, in order to obtain the equivalent of his full pay, to have one-third ( 1/3) of his nonnal salary paid during such extended leave and to have deducted from any available unused current and accumulated sick leave one third ( 1/3) day for 


)7 
each one-third ( I /3) day's pay so received. 
h. This provision shall not apply and no salary payment or salary replacement benefits will be made to a policeman who is absent from work but covered under workers' compensation for wage loss from a concurrent employer. 
3. During a full-time officers' absence on a non-work related illness or disability, the officer shall continue to receive health, dental and vision benefits, but shall not be eligible to earn additional sick leave, personal days or vacation time. Moreover, no officer shall be entitled to receive this non-work related absence benefit for the same onset and continuation of the same illness or disability for more than a cumulative total of seventy-eight (78) weeks during the term 
of this Agreement. 
ARTICLE XI LONG-TERM DISABILITY COMPENSATION 
In the event that a full-time officer has been unable to return to work for one (1) year and is totally disabled, the Borough shall, at its sole cost, purchase an insurance annuity which will 
pay the officer a monthly disability benefit of two-thirds (2/3) of his base annual wage for the full duration of his disability. This benefit shall tenninate upon any full-time officer becoming 
eligible to retire and receive pension benefits. 
ARTICLE XU REASSlGNMENT OF POUCEMEN 
In the event that a full-time police officer suffers an illness or injury which renders him 
temporarily unable to perform his duties as a police officer, but physically capable of performing 
desk clerk duty, the Borough shall endeavor to place the police officer on desk clerk duty at the 
police officer's normal rate of pay. Nothing in this section shall negate the Borough's right to 
place a police officer on disability retirement when the circumstances of his illness or injury 
warrant such retirement.

The Borough shall provide full-time officers after fifteen (15) months of service with the Police Department as a full-time officer with a policy of insurance providing survivor's income if the officer is survived by a spouse or one or more dependent children under the age of eighteen

If the amount of your Insurance is scheduled to reduce within 12 months following the date you apply for the Accelerated Benefit, your Accelerated Benefit will be based on the reduced amount. 
The Accelerated Benefit will be paid to you once in your lifetime in a lump sum. If you recover from your Qualifying Medical Condition after receiving an Accelerated Benefit, we will not ask you for a refund. 
D. Effect On Insurance And Other Benefits 
For any purpose other than premium payment, the amount ofyour Insurance after payment of the Accelerated Benefit will be the greater of the amounts in ( 1) and (2) below; however, if you assign your rights under the Group Policy, the amount ofyour Insurance will be the amount in (2) below.
