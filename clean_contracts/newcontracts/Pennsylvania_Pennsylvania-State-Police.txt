The Commonwealth will implement and administer a Leave Donation Program.

Members may donate annual and personal leave to a designated member in the members bargaining unit who has used all accrued and anticipated paid leave for the current leave calendar year. The leave is to be used for the recipients own catastrophic or severe injury or illness or for the catastrophic or severe injury or illness of a family member. The leave also may be used as bereavement leave if the members family member dies and the member has no accrued or anticipated sick leave available subject to the limitations in Article 14 Section 3.

Section 2.

 a.

 Recipients Recipients must be members in the bargaining unit.

 b.

Family member is defined as a husband wife child step-child foster-child or parent of the member or any other person qualifying as a dependent under IRS eligibility criteria.

c.

A catastrophic or severe illness or injury that poses a direct threat to life or to the vital function of major bodily systems or organs and would cause the member to take leave without pay or terminate employment must be documented on a Family and Medical Leave Act Serious Health Condition Certification form. Donated leave may not be used for work-related injuries or illnesses minor illnesses injuries or impairments sporadic short-term recurrences of chronic non-life threatening conditions short-term absences due to contagious diseases or short-term recurring medical or therapeutic treatments except for conditions such as those listed above.

d.

The absence due to the catastrophic or severe illness or injury of the member or a family member must be for more than 2 workdays in the current leave calendar year. The 2workday absence may be accumulated on an intermittent basis if properly documented as related to the same catastrophic or severe illness or injury. Annual personal sick (for members own serious health condition) sick family (for the serious health condition of a family member) holiday compensatory or unpaid leave may be used during the accumulation period. A separate accumulation period must be met for each catastrophic or severe illness or injury and for each leave calendar year in which donated leave is used. Donated leave may not be applied to the required 2-workday accumulation period.

e.

 All accrued leave must be used as follows before any donation may be received (1) For a members own catastrophic or severe injury or illness all accrued annual sick personal holiday and compensatory leave and all anticipated annual and sick leave for the current leave calendar year must be used.

 S4  (2) For the catastrophic or severe injury or illness of a family member all accrued annual personal holiday and compensatory leave and all anticipated annual leave for the current leave calendar year must be used. All five days of sick family leave and any additional sick family leave for which the member is eligible must be used.

f.

Up to 12 weeks of donated leave per leave calendar year may be received for all conditions of the member and family members cumulatively but donations may not be received in more than two consecutive leave calendar years. Donated leave is added to the recipients sick leave balance on a biweekly basis. Recipients do not repay the donor for donated leave.

Leave usage is monitored closely to ensure that donated leave is used only for absences related to the catastrophic or severe illness or injury. Upon exhaustion of the 12 week donated leave cap a member may request an additional donation of up to thirty (3) days which shall be allowed at the discretion of the Commissioner and shall not be unreasonably denied. Members shall not be required to exhaust personal days before being eligible to access the Leave Donation Program.

g.

The recipients entitlement to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act will be reduced by donated leave that is used. Entitlements to sick leave without pay (for a members own illness) or family care leave without pay (for a family members illness) will also be reduced.

h.

Donated leave may be used on an intermittent basis. However each absence may be required to be medically documented as due to the same catastrophic or severe illness or injury.

i.

A member is not eligible to receive donations of leave if during the previous six months the member has been placed on a written leave restriction or has received a written reprimand or suspension related to attendance.

 j.

Donated leave that remains unused once the member is released by the physician for full-time work when the family members condition no longer requires the members absence or at the end of the leave calendar year must be returned to the donors in inverse order of donation. However if at the end of the year the absence is expected to continue beyond the greater of 2 workdays or the amount of annual and sick leave that could be earned and used in the following leave calendar year donated leave may be carried into the next year.

Section 3.

 Donors  a.

A donor may voluntarily donate annual and personal leave to a member within the donors bargaining unit who meets the requirements of the Leave Donation Program. Donations may be made to multiple members as long as the minimum donation is made to each member.

 55  b.

The donors annual leave balance after donation cannot be less than the equivalent of five workdays of leave (4. hours). Anticipated personal leave may not be donated.

c.

The donation is effected by the completion and submission of a Request to Donate Leave to the Bureau of Human Resources. Leave is deducted from the donors annual andor personal leave balance at the time of donation and transferred to the recipient in order by the date and time the Request to Donate Leave form is received.

d.

Unused donations are returned to the donor if the recipient or family member recovers dies or separates before the donors leave is used or if the recipient does not use the leave by the end of the leave calendar year and is expected to either return to work within 2 workdays or to have sufficient anticipated leave available in the new year to cover the absence.

In accordance with Section l above a member whose family member dies and who does not have accrued or anticipated sick leave available may use donated leave as bereavement leave subject to the limitations in Article 14 Section 3.
