RECOGNITION 
SECTION I -RECOGNITION 
The City recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative concerning the terms and conditions of employment, including compensation, hours, working conditions, retirement, pensions and other benefits for all employees as provided in Act 111 of 1968. 
The Union recognizes the Mayor as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for the City of Pittsburgh. The Union, its agents and representatives, agrees to bargain collectively pursuant to Act 111 of 1968 with only the Mayor or his designated representative. 
The term "employee" as used in this Agreement refers to all individuals occupying positions set forth in Section 6; provided, however, that no individual shall be considered an employee until he or she has successfully completed the training program mandated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or has been employed by the City for ninety (90) days whichever is longer. In addition, in recognition of the fact that persons newly hired to Police Officer positions, normally, will require at least four ( 4) months of full time training, an official "probationary employee" status shall be deemed t_o exist for the six (6) months period commencing upon successful completion of such training by each new employee. 
Upon completion of the second month of his or her probationary status, each new employee shall be accorded the right to appeal, as not being for proper cause, any employment termination action to the Civil Service Commission, provided such appeal is filed within ten (10) work days of the City's notice of that termination.

DUES CHECK-OFF 
SECTION 2 -DUES CHECK-OFF 
A. 1. The City will check off uniform and regular monthly dues and agency shop fees as designated by the Union in writing to the City on the basis of individually signed voluntary check-off authorization cards. This shall include deductions from compensation paid pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act 53 P.S. 637 if the City has received a voluntary check-off authorization card signed by the employee specifically permitting the City to deduct dues from compensation paid pursuant to the Heart and Lung Act. A copy of such authorization card for "the check-off of Union dues shall be 
. furnished to the City. These authorizations shall not be sent more frequently than once each month. Deductions on the basis of authorization cards submitted to the City shall commence for the month in which the City receives such card or in which such card becomes effective, whichever is later. In case of earnings insufficient to cover deductions, a deduction shall be made from the next pay in which there is sufficient earnings or a double deduction may be made from the pay of the following month, provided, however that any accumulation of dues shall be limited to two (2) months. 
I 
2. If the Union shall increase the amount of its monthly and/or annual dues subsequent to 
I 
the execution of then current dues check-off authorization cards by members of the bargaining unit, the then current dues check-off authorization cards shall be considered sufficient authorization to the City to increase the amount of Union dues deducted by it from the earnings of the respective members ofthe bargaining unit. 
2 
3. 
Written notification from an appropriate officer of the Union to the City that the Union has increased its periodic dues shall be considered by the City as constituting adequate notice and authority for it to increase the amount of any dues deduction that it deducts from the earnings of members of the bargaining unit. 

4. 
Employees covered by this Agreement who are not dues paying members of the Union shall be required as a condition of employment to pay, in lieu of dues, an agency shop fee for their proportionate share of the cost of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and the pursuance of matters affecting wages, hours and conditions of employment, but not to exceed the amount of dues uniformly required of members. Such employees shall have the full protection of and full access to the rebate procedure contained in Subsection D of this Agreement which is agreed to by the parties. 

5. 
An employee shall be charged with not meeting the agency shop fee as a condition of employment only if the Union's Financial Secretary has given notice to the employee and the City that the employee has failed to pay the agency shop fee and has not instituted the rebate procedure within the time limits set forth in Sub-Section D. The City shall institute proceedings to discharge the employee within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the notice unless notified to the contrary by the Union. 

6. 
The City shall, at the direction of the Union, make extra dues deductions from an employee who is in delinquent status. If an employee is absent from work for reasons other than those already provided for in this Agreement, the Union may, when said employee returns to work, submit written notification to the City stating the amount of 


3 
dues delinquency and the number of months an extra dues deduction shall be taken from an employee's pay. 
B. The City shall remit to the Union all monies deducted and a list of all employees for whom a deduction has been made on or before the 15th day ofthe month after such deductions are made. 
C. The Union shall indemnify and save the City harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reason of any action or inaction taken by the City for the purpose of complying with any of the provisions of this Section, or in reliance on any list, notice, or assignment furnished under any such provisions. 
D. Agency Shop Fee Payer Objection Policy The Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Pitt Lodge No. l has approved the following Policy governing objections by F.O.P. represented police agency shop fee payers, both the expenditure of their agency shop fees for purposes not related to the costs of exclusive representation. 
1. 
The agency shop fee paid to F.O.P. by non-FOP. members shall be equal to the membership dues for F.O.P. members in the bargaining unit. 

2. 
The amount of the agency shop fee, and a copy of this Policy, shall be distributed by the 

F.O.P. upon implementation of this Policy and each January 15th hereafter to all agency shop fee payers in the bargaining unit. 

3. 
At the end of each fiscal year, the F.O.P.'s expenditures shall be reviewed in order to establish on a pro rata basis what portion of the agency shop fees charged to each agency shop fee payer in the unit to which the policy applies were expended on matters not related to the costs of exclusive representation. The F.O.P. will then prepare, by the 1st day of April following the close of the fiscal year, a report setting forth the results of this review with respect to that previous year. Such report will thereafter be available to any agency shop fee payer who requests a copy. Such requests should be made in writing, by certified mail, return receipt requests, addressed to the F.O.P. at 1428 Banksville Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15216. 

4. 
Upon issuance of the report, the F.O.P. will pay to each person who has timely filed an objection under this policy his/her pro rata share of the amount of agency shop fees which have been expended on matters not related to the costs of exclusive representation (such pro-rata share shall hereafter be referred to as the "amount"), plus accrued interest. 

5. 
Any non-member shop fee payer shall have the right to object to the expenditure of his/her agency shop fees for purposes not attributable to the costs of exclusive representation by filing such objection in writing addressed to the F.O.P. at 1428 Banksville Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15216, and sending a copy to the City Office of Labor Relations at 313 City-County Building, Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219. 

6. 
Upon the filing of such objection, the F.O.P. will immediately deposit an amount equivalent to the agency shop fees of the objector(s) for the months following filing of the objection that remain in the F.O.P.'s fiscal year, in a separate interest-bearing account 


4 
5 
carried by the F.O.P., and will not expend such amount thereafter for any purpose except as set forth herein. 
7. 
Any agency shop fee payer who has timely filed such an objection pursuant to this Policy and who claims that the amount is not in accord with the standard set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Policy, may appeal the F.O.P.'s determination of the amount. Such an appeal shall be commenced by filing such an appeal in writing with the F.O.P. and sending a copy to the City Office of Labor Relations at the addresses above. Any such appeal must be filed no later than 30 days following the issuance of the report required by Paragraph 3 of this Policy. The appeal shall state the basis for the claim that the F.O.P.'s determination of the amount is not in accord with the standard set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Policy. 

8. 
An appeal filed under Paragraph 7 of this Policy shall first be considered by the Executive Board of the F.O.P. or its designee, which shall have the discretion to consolidate all appeals and to require a hearing in determining the appeals or to determine appeals in such other manner as it deems appropriate. In all cases, the F.O.P. Executive Board or its designee shall issue its determination as to the appeal within 30 days of the filing to the appeal, or in the case of consolidated appeals, within 30 days of the filing of the last appeal so consolidated. 

9. 
An appellant dissatisfied with the determination of the F.O.P. Executive Board may further appeal that determination. Such an appeal must be filed, in writing, no later than 15 days after the issuance of the decision of the F.O.P. Executive Board or its designee under Paragraph 8 of this Policy, or else such decision shall be final and binding. Any 


6 
such appeal must be addressed to the F. 0 .P. and a copy sent to the City Office of Labor Relations at the addresses above. 
10. 
All appeals filed pursuant to Paragraph 9 of this Policy will be referred to an impartial decision-maker. Until further notice, all such appeals shall be referred by the F.O.P. to the American Arbitration Association (A.A.A.), pursuant to its 'Rules for Impartial Determination of Union Fees.' The F.O.P. will have the authority to have any and all such appeals consolidated. The impartial decision-maker's jurisdiction shall be limited to determining whether the amount determined by the F.O.P. with respect to the appellants is in accord with the standard set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Policy. The decision of the impartial decision-maker shall be final and binding. The F.O.P. and the appellant shall bear the cost ofall charges made by the A.A.A. and the impartial decision maker equally. 

11. 
All agency shop fee amounts of objectors not paid to them pursuant to Paragraph 4 of this Policy will remain in the account referred to in Paragraph 6 of this Policy until the close of the period for filing an appeal to the Executive Board of the F.O.P. set by Paragraph 7 of this Policy. Ifan objector timely files such an appeal, the amounts in the account of this Policy with respect to such objector will remain in the account until final resolution of the appeal to the impartial decision-maker, as the case may be, and then will be distributed to the F.O.P. and the objector in accordance with the final decision of the appeal, with accrued interest. Ifno such appeal is filed by an objector with the F.O.P. Executive Board within the time period established by Paragraph 7 of this Policy, then all remaining monies in the account with respect to the objector will be distributed to the F.O.P. 

12. 
For the purposes of this Policy, 'file', 'filing' and/or 'filed' means receipt by the recipient designated herein, after mailing by first-class certified mail, return receipt requested. 

13. 
It is the intent of the parties to follow the standards set forth for such procedures by the United States Supreme Court in Chicago Teachers Union, et al v. Hudson, 106 S.Ct. 1066 (1986). Should any section of this procedure be found to be constitutionally deficient, such will not serve to invalidate the remainder of the procedure.

SENIORITY 
SECTION 3 -SENIORITY 
A seniority system based upon continuous service and applicable ability considerations shall be followed for employment security and work assignment determinations, to include annual "Job Pick" selections and awards of and to police service employees, during the term of this Agreement. In connection therewith, the following definitions and rules are to be applied by the City. 
A. Continuous Service -The "continuous service" status of each bargaining unit employee shall mean all "unbroken" service, from the date of his or her initial employment as a Police Officer in the Police Bureau. A break in such service will result, however, upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
1. 
voluntary quit; 

2. 
termination for cause; or 

3. 
absence in excess of five (5) days without any justifiable reason and/or without any "report off' from work within that period of absence. 

4. 
Any continuous absence due to a non-work related disability for a total of twelve (12) continuous months or for a total of twelve (12) cumulative months in a twenty-four (24) month period shall result in a break in continuous service and termination of employment. The period of absence runs prospectively from April 1, 2001. Any employee who is terminated under this provision for a non-work related disability will be able, within five (5) years following termination, to present evidence to the City physician establishing that the non-work related disability has been overcome, and that 


9 
the former officer is able to return to full duty. In such case, the officer will be reinstated, and his continuous service shall be bridged for all purposes. 
B. Job or "Rank" Seniority -Each employee will be accorded job or "rank" seniority, from the date of his or her initial promotion to any rank, with his or her "continuous service" status therefore running from that date. Seniority for any lower ranks held by any employee will continue while he or she holds any higher rank, of any Police Officer job. In the event an employee is reinstated after having terminated employment, he or she shall be accorded full credit for all time served as a Police Officer in the Police Bureau. 
C. Bureau-Wide Seniority -Each employee will be accorded a "bureau-wide" continuous service or "seniority" status from the date of his or her initial employment on any job in the Police Bureau of the City. This seniority shall be applied in cases of any decrease in force and/or recall action affecting employees in his/her job or rank, by the City. 
D. Annual Bidding (Job Pick) Procedures -By September 15 of each calendar year, the Chief of Police shall forward to the F.O.P. his projected manning level notice for the Bureau of Police for the following year. The F.O.P. shall have the right to grieve in an expedited manner any issues concerning the proposed picks. The parties shall select a neutral arbitrator prior to September 15 to decide any expedited grievances so as not to delay the October 1 posting date. 
1. Uniform Division Employees 
a. By October 1, and continuing until October 31, of each calendar year, the Chief of Police shall cause a posting of Projected Manning Level notices indicating 
10 
regular assignments and shifts to be filled by Uniformed Officers, and listing the names, ranks and service dates of such officers assigned, at and for all Police Stations maintained by the City. These notices shall include a "sign up" page or "Pick Sheet" for each position (by shift) to be posted and filled, at and for each such Police Station. The Chief of Police shall have the discretion to create and post units within which qualified Uniformed Police Officers may bid, and place qualified Uniformed Police Officers within them. The City will send to the 
F.O.P. a written statement as to the qualifications it considers in placing employees in the units. The Union shall have the right to grieve in an expedited fashion if it perceives the posting as an attempt to circumvent seniority or other "contractual" rights of Uniformed Police Officers. Effective for job picks for 2006, the twenty five percent (25%) most senior police officers ( excluding sergeants and lieutenants) assigned to work in the uniform division each year shall be permitted to elect the zone in which they will work that year, in order of seniority. *(Final sentence of this paragraph is subject to appeal filed by the City on 1/28/05.) 
b. During the above said "posting" period, all Uniform Police Officers at each Station shall be given an opportunity to sign the Pick Sheet notice reflecting the regular "position" (and shift) of his or her choice. Any employee who fails to sign up for any regular position and shift assignment posted, or whose choice of position and shift is awarded to a senior employee, shall be assigned to one, without regard to his or her seniority status, by the Commander at the Station. 
11 
c.  Draft 4125111 All regular position and shift assignment selections under Paragraph B hereof shall be made and awarded on a "seniority" basis, from among all qualified Uniform Division employees at each Police Station. Any employee who fails to obtain his indicated choice of such assignments will be given a right to make a new choice within the posting period of Paragraph (b) above, and will be considered therefore, on the same basis.  
d.  Effective for the calendar year beginning January 1, 1999, all employees assigned to Zones shall be permitted to bid on car, wagon, utility or COP assignments on the basis of seniority. Regular COP assignments shall be posted and shall indicate the two (2) consecutive pass days and the shift.  
e.  By November 15 of each calendar year, the Chief will post Officer Assignment notices, indicating all regular positions assigned, by name, rank and applicable service date of each employee so assigned, at and for each Police Station, for the next following calendar year. A copy of this notice will be provided to the Local F.O.P. President.  
f.  As provided in Paragraph (a) above, all Station assignments of Uniform Division (and other) employees will be made by the Chief of Police.  
g.  If, after the assignments within a Police Station for a calendar year take effect, an opening in an assignment occurs due to a resignation, retirement, including disability retirement, death, or promotion which the City determines to fill, then  

12 
Draft 4125111 
the vacancy shall be posted for bid within the Police Station or unit before transferring a Uniformed Police Officer from another Police Station or unit. The City may fill such openings at any time by posting for bid, but if the City gives the assignment to Uniformed Police Officers for thirty (30) calendar days then it will be deemed to have determined to post the opening for bid. The assignment and shift shall be posted for bid for ten (I 0) calendar days but otherwise the procedure for bidding shall be the same as under subparagraphs b and c above. Only the initial opening caused by one of the events described above shall be filled by this procedure. Nothing in this subsection shall force the City to make promotions. 
h. 
If, on a particular shift, the City must fill a vehicle assignment open on that shift, then the City shall fill it first from among Uniformed Police Officers who have successfully bid upon vehicle assignments but who have no vehicle available on that shift. If there are more open vehicle assignments on that shift than there are available Uniformed Police Officers who have successfully bid upon vehicle assignments, then the open vehicle assignments will be given to Uniformed Police Officers who successfully bid upon utility assignments, first by request, then by inverse order of seniority. The City may bypass any Uniformed Police Officer for an open vehicle assignment on a particular shift if the City, in good faith, believes that because of compatibility, the Uniformed Police Officer will not be effective in that assignment on that shift. 

i. 
Picks shall be made in the following order 


Captains shall pick first. Lieutenants shall pick second. Sergeants shall pick third. Gold Badge shall pick fourth. Graded Det. shall pick fifth. Master Police Officers shall pick sixth. 4th Year Patrol Officers shall pick seventh. 3rd Year Patrol Officers shall pick eighth. 2nd Year Patrol Officers shall pick ninth. 1st Year Patrol Officers shall pick tenth. 
For seniority purposes in the Detective Bureau only, all persons assigned to the Detective Bureau prior to February 17, 1998 shall have their seniority based upon total service as a Police Officer. Any person permanently appointed to the Detective Bureau after February 17, 1998 shall have their seniority based upon time in grade as a detective. 
2. 
Other Employees A procedure similar to that described in Paragraph (a) above will be followed for regular position and shift assignments to employees "outside" of the Uniform Division. A separate such procedure may be established and applied to any reasonable "groupings" of such employees, as determined by the Chief of Police. 

3. 
Effective January 1, 2001, the parties agree to eliminate the position and practice of utilizing desk sergeants. The parties will create the new assignment of desk officer. 


Draft 4125"11 
Beginning with the bids for calendar year 2002, the desk officer position shall be posted and bid in each zone location in the annual bidding procedure set forth in Section 3.D. The City agrees to fill, by March 1, 2001, those vacancies in the position of sergeant which exist as of the effective date ofthis award. 
E. Transfers and Reassignments 
1. 
Permanent Permanent transfers of employees from their regular position or shift assignments, at any Station, will be made only with the consent of each affected employee, so long as the regular position and shift assignment selected by him continues to be manned at his Station, during that calendar year, by the City. 

2. 
Temporary Station, position and/or shift transfers or reassignments of any employee(s) for a period of seven (7) days or less (five work days and two pass days) -though, not to exceed ten 


(10) such periods for any given officer in any calendar year -shall be deemed "temporary." Normally such transfers shall first be done through seeking volunteers and if an insufficient number of volunteers are available, then the transfers shall normally be made in inverse order of seniority. Such "temporary" transfers or reassignments are to be based upon Police service requirements, as determined by the Chief of Police. The Chief shall have an unfettered right to determine such requirements, and to make such temporary transfers or reassignments, during the period of this Agreement. However, no transfer under this paragraph may be made for disciplinary reasons. In the event of an emergency, the transfers may be made without first seeking volunteers or without 
15 
reverting to the use of inverse order of seniority. If special skills or abilities are needed 
or if the transfer would result in overtime the transfer may be made without first seeking 
volunteers. 
3. 
Personal Transfers Any employee may request a transfer from one shift to another or one station to another within the Operations Division. All such requests shall be in writing with a copy to the Union. Requests for transfer may be granted only for compelling personal reasons or inability to adequately perform assigned duties. Requests for transfer shall be granted provided there is a vacant position as determined by the City, available or another employee will consent to trade shift or station assignment with the employee requesting the transfer and the employee is capable of performing the assigned duties of the new shift or station. In the event that more requests are received than may be accommodated, preference in granting such transfers shall be based on length of continuous service. Final discretion as to whether or not a transfer is to be granted shall rest with the Chief. 

4. 
Bureau Transfers Employees may be transferred by the Chief, or their Commander, either temporarily or permanently, to another shift or station for the good of the Bureau. Bureau transfers, for the purpose of affording necessary police service, shall as far as practicable be in the reverse order of length of continuous service. Nothing in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection prohibits the City from transferring employees from their picked job assignments at one Police Station or unit to another police station or unit in accordance with this paragraph. 

5. 
Employees are to have two (2) weeks notice of permanent, involuntary transfers from any Police Station to another, except in the case of emergencies or as the needs of public safety require. 


16 
F. Seniority Roster Postings -Two (2) separate Seniority Rosters will be posted at each Police Station, one ( 1) listing the names, ranks, service dates, station and shift assignments of all bargaining unit employees and the other listing the names, ranks, service dates and shift assignments of employees at that particular Police Station. The City shall supply to the Fraternal Order of Police, a seniority list in inverse order of seniority with dates of promotion to last rank and category within the Pittsburgh Police. Said seniority list shall be provided to the Fraternal Order of Police no later than June 1st of each calendar year. 
17

28 
Draft 4125111 
(3) persons to a Contract Review Committee, which shall meet in December in each year of the term of the contract to determine the amount of savings from compensatory time used verses overtime earned. If, at the end of any calendar year, the cost of wage and benefit increases covered by this Agreement exceeds the ceiling allowed under the Act 4 7 Plan by an aggregate amount in excess of $250,000, then the wage increase for the next calendar year will be adjusted to eliminate such excess. If, at the end of calendar year 2013, there is an aggregate savings over the ceiling allowed under the Act 47 Plan, then 50% ofthat savings shall be divided among those who are active officers and members of the bargaining unit as of December 31, 2013 in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per officer. In the event that the Contract 
29 
Review Committee comes to impasse over such wage adjustments, then the current Act 111 neutral arbitrator shall rule based on this Agreement and the Act 4 7 Plan. 
7. To determine appropriate police officer pay grades, continuous service status is as defined in Section 3 -Seniority (A)(l)(2)(3) and (4).

32 
HOURS OF WORK 
SECTION 8 -HOURS OF WORK 
A. This Section defines the nonnal hours of work, but shall not be construed, either, as a guarantee of hours of work and pay or as a basis for calculating overtime hours of work and pay, except as provided for, otherwise, in this Agreement. 
1. 
The nonnal workday shall be eight (8) consecutive hours of work. An employee shall be entitled to a meal period of one-half (1/2) hour while on duty during the eight (8) hour work period. It is understood that the employee is on duty and on call at any time during the meal period.

Such time worked shall be compensated at the regular rate or at the overtime rate, depending upon whether it qualified as straight-time or overtime, provided, however, that employees required to attend pretrial or Federal, State, County, or City Court and Magistrate sessions shall be guaranteed at least three (3) hours pay at the applicable rate. This paragraph shall also apply to Law Department and Human Relations Hearings, Merit Board, OMI interviews, and in Trial Boards and Boards of inquiry for sitting members or witnesses for the prosecution. 
An officer who appears in court as a defendant in a civil or criminal case arising out of 
the performance of police duties may elect to have his shift changed to coincide with 
scheduled court appearances. An officer electing such change would waive any claim to 
overtime within a twenty-four (24) hour period in relation to his regularly scheduled shift. 
Subject to the approval of the County and the courts, an officer required to attend City 
Court must select either morning or afternoon schedule for court hearings. No election 
will be honored, however, if it would create a claim for overtime compensation that 
would not otherwise exist.

34 
An employee whose court appearance starts one and one-half hours or less prior to the employee's shift may be required to report for duty immediately after the court appearance and the three hour court appearance guarantee shall be inapplicable. 
Ifan employee's court appearance starts more than one and one-half hours prior to the employee's shift and ends prior to the employee's shift, the three hour court appearance guarantee shall ·be applicable whether or not the employee is asked to report to work immediately after the court appearance.

If a court appearance occurs one and one-half (1 ½) hours or less after the end of an employee shift, the employee may be held over for the court appearance. In this event, the employee shall be paid for hours worked only and the three (3) hour court appearance guarantee shall be inapplicable. 
An employee required to make two court appearances in a day may be held over on duty from the first to the second court appearance. In this event the three hour court appearance guarantee is applicable only to the first court appearance. Overtime hours accrued as a result ofcourt time can, at the discretion ofthe officer, be paid as overtime or be banked as compensatory time subject to the rules and procedure set forth in Appendix A 
35 
D. Call Outs -Except for Court or Magistrate sessions covered by Paragraph B above, an employee called out to work for any period other than the period of his or her previously scheduled hours of work shall be guaranteed at least four (4) hours of work or pay and shall be compensated at applicable overtime pay rates for such 'call out' time. Previously scheduled hours of work of any affected employee shall not be rearranged or reduced because of call out work under these provisions. 
E. Except in "emergency" situations, or where requested and agreed to by the affected employees, any change in previously scheduled hours of work shall be made and posted no later than Thursday of the week preceding the calendar week in which the change is to take effect, or by the end of the last shift worked by the affected employee during that preceding week, whichever occurs first. 
F. When any change is made in the schedule of, any employee in any manner contrary to the provisions of Paragraph E above, he/she shall be deemed to have reported for work on his regular shift and shall be paid on that basis, with all other hours worked on that day compensated for, at the appropriate "overtime" pay rate. 
G. Shift Differential -For hours worked on the afternoon shift there shall be paid a premium rate of 2.00% of the hourly rate; and for hours worked on the night shift there shall be paid a premium rate of 3.00% of the hourly rate; and for hours worked between 4:00 
P.M. and 11 :00 P.M. there shall be paid a premium rate of 4.00% of the hourly rate. 
36

a) 
An employee regularly scheduled for the day or afternoon shift who completes his or her regular eight-hour turn and continues to work into the following shift shall be paid the applicable shift differential for all hours worked on the following shift. 

b) 
An employee who completes his or her regular eight-hour turn and after going off duty is called out for another shift within the same workday shall be paid the applicable shift differential if any, for the hours worked on the other shift.

H. EXCHANGE OF PASS DAYS 
1. 
Employees assigned to the same station, division and of equal rank may exchange complete pass days and tours of duty, subject to the approval of the Assistant Chief and/or his Designated Representative. 

2. 
No overtime liability due to such exchanges shall accrue to the City nor shall the City assume responsibility for enforcement or repayment of time between the officers involved. 

3. 
In no event are exchanges of duty tours to be granted in order for any employee to make profit or for the purpose of assuming outside employment of any length or duration. 


38 
I. Nothing in the Award of December 30, 2004 shall be construed to change the present practice regarding minimum pay for court appearances.

The workweek shall consist of seven (7) consecutive days beginning 12:01 a.m. on Monday. 

2. 
The workday is the twenty-four (24) hour period beginning with the time the employee begins work.

The regular rate of pay as used in this Agreement shall mean the standard hourly wage rate which the employee would have received for the work assigned had it been performed during the 40 hour work week. 

4. 
For purposes of overtime payments, based on Wheeler v. Hampton, 399 F.3rd 238 (C.A.3(Pa.) 2005), the annual base pay will include longevity pay, and shift differential at the median rate, proposed by the City ofthree (3%) percent. 


B. Overtime rates of one and one-half (1 ½) times the regular rate will be paid for: 
1. During any workweek wherein an officer actually works more than forty hours, the hours in excess offorty hours will be paid at a premium rate of one and one halftimes the officer's regular rate. Overtime hours accrued as a result of this provision can, at the discretion ofthe officer, be paid as overtime or be banked as compensatory time subject to the rules and procedure set forth in Appendix A. 
C. If officers are forced to work on pass days, then the order of selection shall be by inverse seniority. 
40 
Draft 4125111 
D. Payment of overtime rates shall not be duplicated for the same hours worked. Hours compensated for at overtime rates shall not be counted further for any purpose in determining overtime liability under the same or any other provisions ofthis Agreement. 
E. Improper Absenteeism Exclusion Any employee who absents himself (herself) from work without permission or justification, or whose pattern of absences otherwise demonstrates an abuse (it is to be noted that patterns of attendance abuse do properly subject an employee to discipline), and who does not challenge the determination that such absence(s) were made without permission or justification, under this Agreement, may be required to make up the time not worked, in four ( 4) hour periods, at any time and in any assignment directed therefore, by the Chief of Police. 
All "make-up" work under this provision will be compensable on a "regular time" pay basis; provided that any affected employee be accorded an option to elect and accept a suspension penalty for periods not to exceed three (3) days and a fine in an amount not to exceed three (3) days' pay, in addition--in lieu of such make-up work--for each improper absence. Any unchallenged improper failure by the employee to "make up" any time lost, as directed by the Chief, shall be deemed an election and acceptance of a suspension penalty and fine under this Section. 
Any election and acceptance of such suspension penalty and fine under this provision shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any right to protest that suspension penalty and fine, under any City or State Law or Agreement provision in effect at the time. 
41 
F 
. All shift changes shall occur on the first of each month. The first eight (8) hours worked on the first day of a new schedule shall be compensated at straight time. 

G. 
OVERTIME PAY AND ACTING PAY OPPORTUNITIES 

1. 
Whenever the need arises to hire on over time a lieutenant or sergeant ( and on-duty manpower is not available), hire the person of the rank to be filled if the cost is the same as hiring a lower rank to act in a higher capacity. (Thus, the practice will continue of making a lower rank act in a higher capacity, as long as it is not on overtime and the cost is only acting pay.) 

2. 
As long as the lieutenant or sergeant who is offered the overtime is not on pass, this will prevail. A lieutenant or sergeant who is on pass is free to volunteer to work at time and a half, provided he/she agrees not to demand the overtime rate applicable for pass day work. This in no way creates a mandatory manning level, and the Bureau will continue to have a lower rank act if on-duty manpower is available. 

3. 
Offers will first be made to the lieutenant and sergeant on the shift and at the duty location that has the manpower shortage. This will be done by seniority. Ifno one on the shift is available then the other shifts will be contacted. This will also be done by seniority. If no one is available then any supervisor from the prior shift will stay. 




1. Ifthis procedure is violated by anyone under the rank of Commander, there will not be any grievances accepted by the FOP, and the City will not be required to pay any amount to the lieutenant/sergeant who was not offered the overtime.

1) the officer makes a written request to his Commander in advance of the vacation period specifying 

(a) 
the last date he will work m the expiring year before commencing vacation and 

(b) 
the date of his return to work in the New Year; 



(2) 
the request must be approved in writing by the Commander in advance of the officer commencing the vacation; and 

(3) 
the officer must physically work his/her entire shifts on the last date before vacation and the date of return as stated in the written request submitted to the Commander. 


Where the Commander has granted the request, but an officer subsequently fails to work the specific shifts identified in writing at the time of request, the officer will be marked "X" for days absent in the New Year as required by the One Day Work Rule. 
B. Further, when the Bureau determines that an officer is properly marked "Holiday" on January 1, the One Day Work Rule is waived for vacation, personal days, DH days, VD 
58 
days and AP days commencing January 2, provided the Officer complies with the procedure and attendance requirements stated in the paragraph above. 
Example: (1) Officer submits memo to Commander on Dec. 13, 2002 requesting vacation from Friday Dec. 27, 2002 through Friday January 3, 2003; (2) The memo must specify the last date the officer will physically work in the expiring year and the date of return to work in the New Year; (3) Failure to physically work on the date of return stated in the request will result in application of the One Day Work Rule, i.e., the officer will be marked "X" (absent without pay) or "Y" (AWOL), as appropriate, for days absent in the New Year. 
0. Any officer who is on leave of absence for which he or she does not receive wages from the City shall be responsible to pay the employee contribution portion of his benefits.

INSURANCE 
SECTION 14 -INSURANCE 
A. LIFE INSURANCE 
1. 
Each active employee shall be insured by the City during the term of this Agreement for an amount equal to the employee's annual base salary rounded off to the next highest hundred dollars of Group Life Insurance with double indemnity during the employee's employment with the City of Pittsburgh during the term of this Agreement. The City shall pay the full cost of such insurance including any rate increases which occur during the term of this Agreement. 

2. 
Each employee who retires during the term of this Agreement shall, upon such retirement, be provided seven thousand five hundred ($7,500) dollars of life insurance coverage, to include such coverage as provided under any disability retirement benefits granted under the Pension Plan in effect on January 1, 1976. 


B. HEALTH INSURANCE 
I. Active Police Officer Health Insurance 
1. Effective January 1, 2005 active police officers will be offered the "Next Generation Health Plan" as set forth in the document presented at arbitration and attached as Appendix A. The Act 47 Plan adopted by the City of Pittsburgh designed a new healthcare plan calling for employee contributions. It recognizes the uncertainty of future costs and the need for flexibility to amend the benefit 
60 
Draft 4125111 
design and/or the amount of the employee contribution on an ongoing annual basis in order to enact savings and contain future cost increases. * (Part of this paragraph is subject to appeal filed by the City on 1/28/05.) 
The Act 47 Plan calls for a minimum 15% employee contribution. The City of Pittsburgh is self-insured therefore the proper method to calculate the 15% contribution is the annual cost for active police officers for the prior year. The evidence presented showed projected costs for medical and prescription coverage for active officers in 2004 at $4.026,825. Effective January 1, 2005, officers shall make the following monthly contributions toward healthcare: 
1.) Individual -$30.00 2.) Husband/Wife -$75.00 3.) Family -$90.00 
It is recognized that the City will make annual adjustments to the contribution rates. The Union may utilize the grievance procedure to challenge the amount of any annual adjustment. The City has the right to purchase fully insured health care plans or to self-insure for purposes of health care coverage. The parties agree that there will be a contract re-opener for negotiations of health care benefits for active employees for 2011 and beyond. During these negotiations, the parties will also discuss alternatives for 2004 retirees. 
2. 
Future pre-Medicare retirees, provided they were hired prior to January 1, 2005, will be offered the same plan choices as active employees. 

3. 
Existing pre-Medicare retirees will be offered the active employee choices as an option. 


61 
4. 
Employees may make an election of health care plan, as provided under Section 14-B-1, at least once each year, at a time determined by the City. 

5. 
a. Ifan employee covered under this agreement, is married to another employee of the City, only one employee shall receive health insurance coverage through the City. The employee that receives health insurance through the City shall provide health insurance coverage for both City employees and eligible dependents. The employees involved may decide which employee will receive such insurance. If the employee covered under this agreement does not receive health insurance coverage through the City, he or she may enroll in the waiver program explained in Section 14 (B)(5) (c). 

b. 
If an employee, covered under this agreement, is married to an individual who has health insurance coverage through an employer other than the City, the City employee may waive health insurance coverage through the City. If the employee covered under this agreement does not receive health insurance coverage through the City, he or she may enroll in the waiver program explained in Section 14 (B) (5) (c). 

c. 
The City will only accept a waiver of health insurance coverage if the employee provides proof that he or she is enrolled in another health insurance plan. Acceptable proof will be an enrollment card with the subscriber's name, identification number (Social Security Number) and group number. The City 




62 
reserves the right to verify that the employee is enrolled in another health insurance plan. 
An employee will be able to waive his/her health insurance coverage during the annual open enrollment period or within 31 days after incurring a change in life or family status. Changes in life and family status are those listed below: 
Change in life and family status Effect on }Vaiver Marriage/Divorce City employee may enroll in waiver program or de­enroll from waiver program and select a health insurance plan. Death of Spouse/Dependent City employee may enroll in waiver program or de­enroll from waiver program and select a health insurance plan. Birth/ Adoption/Legal Guardianship City employee may enroll in waiver program or de­enroll from waiver program and select a 
health insurance plan. Spouse Begins Employment City employee may enroll in the waiver program. Spouse Loses/Reduces/Ends 
Employment City employee may de-enroll in waiver program and select a health insurance plan. Within 31 days of a life and family status change, the employee must provide the City's Employee Compensation Office written notice of such change. An employee will only be permitted to re-enroll in the City's health insurance program if such a change causes the employee waiving health insurance coverage to lose his or her other health insurance coverage. Re-enrollment into the City's health insurance program will be effective so as to prevent a lapse in coverage. The City will require proof that the life and family status change has occurred. 
63 
6. 
In the event an officer is "killed in service," health care coverage identical to that offered to active police officers shall be granted, without contribution, to the officer's surviving spouse and surviving dependents."

The couple has been together for a minimum of twelve (12) months prior to registration and has not terminated another registration with the City of Pittsburgh less than twelve (12) months prior to the instant registration.

2. Provide three (3) documents demonstrating mutual responsibility, i.e. joint utility bills, joint bank accounts, joint leases, etc. 
will be eligible for benefits under the domestic partner/common law spouse benefits program.

the 1992 Working Agreement, as added by the award of Edward E. McDaniel, on December 22, 1979 shall not apply. 
III. 
This group of retirees will be provided with the option to enroll themselves, and their spouses at the time of retirement, in one of the manage care health insurance plans described in Section 14 

(B) (1) during a specified open enrollment period. Any retiree who terminates his/her Husband and Wife BC/BS/MM Indemnity plan for a managed care plan will be permitted to re­enroll in the BC/BS/MM Indemnity Plan only once. During a future open enrollment period, any subsequent termination of the BC/BS/MM Indemnity plan for a managed care plan will be irrevocable. Such an election into a managed care health insurance plan will be voluntary. 

N. 
If the retiree selects a managed care plan, his/her monthly pension deduction will be the difference between the Individual rate paid by the City at the time of retirement and the applicable premium for the selected managed care plan. 


7. Any employee who retires after January 1, 1984 will be allowed to continue his or her medical insurance coverage for himself/herself and spouse only, through the City.
