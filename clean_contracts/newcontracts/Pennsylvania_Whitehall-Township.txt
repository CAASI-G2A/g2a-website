II. When notified at least three (3) hours in advance of circumstances which require assignment of overtime to maintain adequate patrol coverage, the supervisor will assign overtime duty using the following steps: 
A. Contact an officer who is on a regularly scheduled day off ("R" Days) in descending order of seniority. 
1. 
The Supervisor of the on-duty shift will mark the Overtime Call-Out Checklist to indicate officers who are on scheduled days off. A copy of the checklist is attached and will be updated as necessary. 

2. 
The Supervisor of the on-duty shift will ensure that the officers whose names are marked on the list are contacted in order of seniority to determine if they are available for overtime duty during the affected shift. 

3.

Page 44 
shortage shall be offered overtime. If the first officer contacted shall prefer not to accept the assignment, the supervisor shall continue to contact all other officers on their regularly scheduled days off by seniority, offering the overtime assignment. 
5. 
If attempts to contact officers on regularly scheduled days off are unsuccessful, officers who are on duty during the affected shift must be contacted in descending order of seniority. The checklist must be marked to indicate the names of the officers contacted and the response to the contact. If no officer in the off­going shift indicates a willingness to work the overtime, the overtime will be assigned to the officer with the least seniority. This overtime should be for a maximum of four (4) hours whenever possible. 

6. 
Officers scheduled for the on-coming shift will be contacted in descending order of seniority (using the checklist) and asked to accept the residual four (4) hours of overtime in the affected shift. If no officer in the on­coming shift indicates a willingness to work the overtime, the overtime will be assigned to the least senior officer who was notified.

4. 
An officer may choose to change the number. He/she must submit the request in writing to the Lt. of Patrol or their designee. The Call Out List must be updated and dated by the Lt. of Patrol. The officer requesting the change must be notified and acknowledge the change in his/her call out number, before this number can be utilized in the call out procedure.
