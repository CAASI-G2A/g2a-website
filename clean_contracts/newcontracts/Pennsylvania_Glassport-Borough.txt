Exhibit A -Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy 
Borough of Glassport 
Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy 
The Borough of Glassport ("Employer") believes that a drug and alcohol free workplace is essential to the welfare of its Employees and the general public. It is the policy of the Employer to test for drug and alcohol abuse when there is probable cause to believe that an Employee is involved with or under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace. In addition, each Employee may be subject to up to two (2) mandatory drug and alcohol tests administered on a random basis each calendar year. Testing by the Employer for cause shall not count toward an individual's mandatory drug testing obligation for the remainder of the calendar year. 
Refusal to submit to testing shall be regarded as a positive test result for purposes ofthis Policy. Testing will be for alcohol and illegal substances, including some medications available by prescription. If the Employee tests positive for the prescribed drug, the testing agent will verify usage through the prescribing physician. Once verified, the testing agent will record the test result as a negative result to the Employer. If the testing agent is not able to verify the prescription, the positive result will be reported to the Employer. 
The drug screen administered for marijuana/cannabis must be able to determine influence over presence in order for the Policy terms to apply. Urine specimen drug testing and screening shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following Standard 9-Drug Panel for illicit drugs with the cutoffs set forth below: 
DRUG  IMMUNOASSAY SCREEN CUTOFF  GC/MS CONFIRMATION CUTOFF  
Amphetamines Cocaine & Metabolite Opiates Phencyclidine (PCP) Barbiturates Benzodiazepines Methadone Methaqualone Propoxyphene  1,000 ng/ml 300 ng/ml 25 ng/ml 300 ng/ml 300 ng/ml As oxazepam 300 ng/ml 300 ng/ml 300 nq/ml  500 ng/ml 300 ng/ml 25 ng/ml Each 100 ng/ml Each 100 ng/ml ( except alprazolam at 50 ng/ml) 100 ng/ml 100 ng/ml Each 100 nq/ml  

All test results will be strictly confidential. Results will be reported to the President of Council. Test results will not be discussed with any other Employee of the Employer, 
22 

r 
other than the Mayor and/or the Chief of Police for scheduling purposes. 
If the test reveals that the Employee has an alcohol level of 0.05 or greater or has illegal drugs in his/her system, the following shall apply: 
First Positive Result 
The President of Council will discuss the positive result with the Employee and a Union representative, if requested by the Employee. Based on that discussion, the Employee shall: 
1. 
Be suspended without pay provided; however, that health insurance, provided that the Employee is complying with all recommended treatment, shall be continued; and 

2. 
Be referred to a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) approved by the Employer. 


Employees entering the rehabilitation program will be required to fulfill all the requirements of the program, including any additional drug and alcohol testing. The program, not the Employer, will establish requirements for successful completion. The Employer will be notified when the Employee has successfully completed the program. 
If the Employee successfully completes the program, he/she will be reinstated with no break in seniority. The Employer may test the reinstated Employee at its discretion on as many occasions as the Employer, in its sole discretion, determines to be appropriate, for cause or randomly, during the following twelve (12) months to assure continued compliance. 
If the Employee refuses to participate or fails to successfully complete the program, he/she will be terminated. 
Subsequent Positive Results 
If the Employee fails a subsequent drug or alcohol test within three (3) years of a prior positive test, he or she will be terminated. Failure of a subsequent drug or alcohol test beyond three (3) years shall be regarded as a first positive result. 
Compliance with the foregoing policy shall be subject to the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure. However, the discipline defined in this policy shall not be subject to change and/or alteration by an arbitrator. An arbitrator's authority shall be solely limited to a determination as to whether an Employee has violated the terms of this policy.
